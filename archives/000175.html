<p><a href="http://pdml.sourceforge.net/">Portable Document Markup Language (PDML)</a> is a library to output PDF using PHP and an HTML-like markup language.<br />
The <a href="http://pdml.sourceforge.net/gettingstarted.php">"getting started"</a> page describes how to use it: install the library, create a PHP file starting with &lt;?php include "pdml.php" ?> and start outputting PDML. <br />
The PDML will be automatically converted to a PDF file using the <a href="http://www.fpdf.org/">FPDF class</a>.</p>

<p>I was curious how this works, as it seemed pretty different from previous similar libraries (PDFLib, FPDF), that offered a programmatic API to generate PDF DOMs instead of a markup language.</p>

<p>Looking at the very end of <i>pdml.php</i> you can notice a call to <i>ob_start("ob_pdml")</i>, with <i>ob_pdml</i> being defined above as <i>function ob_pdml($buffer)</i>. <br />
That turns out to be the key. Check out the documentation for the <a href="http://php.net/ob_start">ob_start</a> PHP function.</p>

<p><i>ob_start</i> will turn output buffering on and will give the callback function a chance to process it. That's the trick for this seamless custom markup conversion using PHP ;-)</p>

<p>I wonder if Flash could be similarly outputted from PHP using a markup language (that would wrap the <a href="http://ming.sourceforge.net/">Ming</a> library). <br />
There could also be an Excel markup language, based on <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/spreadsheet_writeexcel/">PHP Spreadsheet_WriteExcel</a>, or an image markup language to generate PNG and JPEG image using the <a href="http://www.boutell.com/gd/">GD graphics library</a>.</p>
<p><u>Update:</u> <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2004/05/12/simpleMiniLanguages">Simon and some commenters on his site</a> came up with other uses of this custom markup language technique: running XSLT or Html Tidy on this second layer of processing.<br />
Harry Fuecks mentioned a very cool technique to have Apache automatically prepend the file with the extra PHP tag (using <i>php_value auto_prepend_file myPhpInclude.php</i> in the .htaccess).</p>

<p>I wonder if something like <i>ob_start</i> is available in ASP.Net...</p>

<p><u>Update:</u><br />
ASP.Net does support a similar "second pass processing" technique. The <a href="http://aspalliance.com/articleViewer.aspx?aId=71">"Intercept and modify the output created from a ASP.Net page"</a> article describes how to do that. This relies on setting an <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfSystemWebHttpResponseClassFilterTopic.asp">output Filter on the HTTPResponse class</a>.<br />
Using inline aspx, it should be possible to have something very similar to PDML. I guess it would even be possible to write server-side controls to output blocks.</p>

<p><u>Update:</u><br />
<a href="http://www.fiftyfoureleven.com/sandbox/weblog/2004/jun/the-definitive-css-gzip-method/">Gzip your CSS</a> using the ob_start PHP trick (and the auto_prepend_file configuration in Apache).</p>

<p>I think using this library with Smarty templates would also lead to some nice reusable components. I've posted a few ideas on my PHP blog.</p>

<p>Great ideas, somthing like 'PDML PHP tricks' was on my list of things to look for today. Thanks!</p>

<p>I was at the MVP Summit welcome reception tonight.  It was awesome to finally meet some of the people I've been talking to on-line for a long time. It was also cool to talk to all the new people I didn't know beforehand.  At least three people read my name tag and say “Are you Gretchen's husband?  I love her blog.” I'll be at some of the developer track talks tomorrow and the dinner in the evening. </p>

<p>Thanks for the interesting articles and the reading.  Unfortunately I'm still incredibly lost on PDML and stuff.  Would anyone mind if I e-mailed them a couple questions?</p>

<p>Is this blog still active?  I am interested in more about PDML and I would like to send email you a few questions(or maybe just point me in the right direction).  Thanks!</p>
