<p>Many people don't seem to know what Nutella is. It is simply put the most delicious and addictive hazelnut chocolate spread in the world. It makes for great breakfast, snacks, deserts, spread on bread, croissants, crepes or anything else you fancy, with a drink of milk or orange juice.</p>

<p>Next time you go grocery shopping, look for the magic little jar, usually in the breakfast/jam section. Your kids (if you have any) and friends will love you for it ;-)<br />
But be aware that once you tasted this sweet goodness, it's hard to let it go.</p>
