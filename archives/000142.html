<p>Experiments and simulations have found M&Ms to have a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/13/science/13MATH.html">very good packing density</a>. They achieve a 71% density in random arrangements, compared to 64% for spheres (and 74% for regularly stacked spheres).</p>

<p>You've got to love M&Ms ;-)</p>

Roland Piquepaille <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0105910/2004/03/29.html#a791">points out</a> "A team of computer scientists at the Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI) has just developed Contpack, a 3D software to solve this problem and to maximize the volume utilization of containers".</p>
