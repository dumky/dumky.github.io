<p>Here is a layout that I have been struggling with but still haven't found a good HTML/CSS implementation for.</p>

<p>Basically I want to make a block of text look like old print paper, with alternate color lines. That is, every odd line should have a green background and every even line should have a white background.</p>

<p>What makes this tricky is that this layout should be resistant to font scaling and window resizing (ie. text wrapping).</p>

<p><u>Green bar computer printout paper example:</u></p>

<p><img src="http://www.workplacesupply.com/catalog/pictures/standard/ptop0041.jpg"/></p>
<p>So far the evaluated solutions:<br />
- have a background image with color strips and use a fixed line height.<br />
This resists to window resizing but isn't great for font resizing (if fonts become big lines will overlap each other). This is the best solution so far.</p>

<p>- have a table with colored cells placed beneath the text, using layers.<br />
This resists to font scaling if each cell of the "color-table" hold a &nbsp; character, but it doesn't resist window resizing because you don't know how many rows this table should hold, since it depends on the wrapping of the text.</p>

<p><u>Update:</u> Related but no cigar, a <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/zebratables/">javascript trick</a> to alternate background colors for every other row in a table.</p>

______________________________________



<p>As a riff on your best solution above, you can write a simple CGI script to generate a background image based on a parameter value, which you can tie (via alternate style sheets in CSS, or javascript, or whatever else) to the font-size and line-height.</p>

<p>Loosely:</p>

<p><br />
&lt;Style&gt;<br />
&lt;!--</p>

<p>.printpaper {<br />
   font-size: 14px;<br />
   line-height: 20px;<br />
   background: url(<a href="http://yourdomain.com/yourscript.cgi?line=20px)">http://yourdomain.com/yourscript.cgi?line=20px)</a> repeat; <br />
}</p>

<p>--&gt;<br />
&lt;/Style&gt;</p>
