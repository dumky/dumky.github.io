<p>Roland Piquepaille was pointing out today that <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0105910/2003/10/24.html#a623">regular ballpoint pen in fact work in space</a>. Apparently, the Russian used them for some time, after using pencils (that are more troublesome), while the American used fancy/expensive <a href="http://www.snopes.com/business/genius/spacepen.asp">Fisher Space Pen</a>. But it seems the Fisher pen does also allow writing in more extreme conditions (vaccum, underwater, extreme temperatures).</p>

<p>In last month's Popular Science, an experiment by Theodore Gray. It uses very intense magnetic fields to <a href="http://www.popsci.com/popsci/science/article/0,12543,490445,00.html">shrink coins</a>. Google also brings Bert Hickman as having performed this experiment.<br />
I'm hoping to get a scientist friend of mine understand how this works. I'll post more details then.</p>

<p>Jean-Louis Naudin built some <a href="http://jnaudin.free.fr/lifters">levitating structures (lifters)</a> that uses an electrodynamic effect to lift small loads into the air, with no moving part.<br />
I've had the occasion to one work and altough I don't understand the phenomenon so far, it was really impressive.</p>

<p>Slashdot recently pointed to a nice experiment that aims at <a href="http://physics.about.com/cs/opticsexperiments/a/290903.htm">measuring the speed of light with a microwave</a>.</p>
