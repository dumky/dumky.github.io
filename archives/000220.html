<p>A picture may be worth a thousand words, but a demo video is often more useful when it comes to software, especially GUI. Of course <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/5814">text still rules</a> and man pages shouldn't be replaced with "man videos", but demos are a great way to learn about an application.</p>

<p>Some products offered online flash introductions/tutorials, but most of the time they are impersonal and soporific. Recording of live demos are more interesting. <br />
Channel 9 has been doing some (ex: <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=25915">Monad shell demo</a>). But <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/000089.html">from experience</a>, recording the person is usually not as informative as recording the screen or whiteboard. Jon Udell has been advocating this format: recording the display directly, along with a voice over commentary. And he baptized it <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/11/17.html#a1116">"screencast"</a>.</p>

<p>I agree with him that this format is <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2004/11/11/primetime.html">going to become more popular</a>, as the tools democratize (Camtasia sells for 299$) or some free tools like <a href="http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/vnc2swf/">vnc2swf</a> become more user-friendly and efficient. </p>

<p>It's not only useful for application demos but also for recording presentations. The best recorded powerpoint-style presentation I've seen is <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/000080.html">Lessig on free culture</a>. But even for less talented performers, recording presentations combining slides, voice and ink, would make them both remotely viewable and more lively. </p>

<p>You can record narrated Powerpoint presentations (using <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/powerpoint/producer/prodinfo/">Producer  for Powerpoint</a> or <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/products/studio/powerpointaddin.asp">Camtasia's Powerpoint add-in</a> for example), but it would be nice if Powerpoint included a "whiteboard" or freeform ink mode. But you can also do that by including some blank slides in your presentation.</p>
<p>I recently made a screencast for some collegues with great success and it was received with enthusiasm. I used one of the tools that Jon recommended, <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/products/studio/default.asp">Camtasia Studio</a>, as it can be viewed on most platforms, using Flash. It convinced me that a lot of useful knowledge could be exchanged using this format. </p>

<p>My narration skills are not too good (yet ;-) so I had to record some parts multiple times and do some editing, but Camtasia made it quite easy. <br />
Integrating the presentation with some transcripts would be useful for skimming through and text indexing, but Camtasia doesn't seem to offer this feature. </p>

<p>That application is amazingly efficient on screen capture - it's as though it's not even running.<br />
