<p>Here is a cool DB trick that a friend of mine showed me a while back. The problem is basically how to efficiently access a tree stored in a relational/SQL database.<br />
The solution where you store the parent of a node in the node/row itself works, but can't be retrieved in-depth without using some kind of a loop or reccursion.</p>

<p>Joe Celko seems to one of the most mentioned DB experts on this matter. Here is an <a href="http://www.intelligententerprise.com/001020/celko.shtml">intro he wrote on reprensenting trees as "nested sets"</a>.</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b><br />
A double numbering or indexing is done globally on the tree, by giving each node/row a left index and right index. These indexes are set sequentially starting with left=1 on the root, and walking through the tree in-depth. The left index is the value of the sequence when you first reach a node (on the left side, if you do a drawing) and the right index is the value of the counter when you reach the node the second time.<br />
Below is an illustration of this numbering:</p>

(from http://i.cmpnet.com/intelligententerprise/gifs/Celko.10.19.Fig1s.gif)</p>

<p>Some of the nice properties of this schema are that non-reccursive queries can be used to retrieve some meaningful parts of the tree:<br />
- a leaf has <i>(right=left+1)</i>,<br />
- a subbranch (under a node with leftbase and rightbase as indexes) verifies <i>(leftbase &lt; left AND right &lt; rightbase)</i>,<br />
- the path back to the root starting at a node (with leftnode, rightnode as indexes) can be found similarly with <i>(left &lt; leftnode AND rightnode &lt; right)</i>.</p>

<p>One of the problem is that each time a new node is inserted, approximately half of the existing nodes/rows need to be updated, to maintain the consistency of this indexing. This could be a problem for trees that are updated frequently.</p>

<p>If you know of any large scale implementation of trees in SQL using this system or any other, please let me know.</p>
