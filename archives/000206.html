<h2 class="title">Comment tracking</h2>

<p><a href="http://commentstrack.net/">CommentsTrack</a> is a new project taking another stab at the comment tracking problem: "How do you follow up on comments you posted?"</p>

<p>My main concern so far is that I would get spam pings. In a previous post about <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/000153.html">comment authentication and tracking</a> I tried to address that issue by using the authentication exchange to establish some trust between the comment server and the user's authentication/signature server.</p>

<p>The lag problem that the spec draft mentions is interesting. If the comment server has to send many pings for each comment, and the pings are synchronous, then posting a comment takes a long time. But the asynchronous ping and other approaches are not as simple...</p>

<p>A possible solution is to use img tags to do a minimal ping, and have the browser load them. When a tracking server receives a minimal ping, it can then fetch the complete information about the update. <br />
If the tracking server doesn't make that request for any reason, then the minimal ping will be included in another user's page, until a maximum retry count and time limit are reached.<br />
One downside of this approach is that the web bug images shouldn't be placed on pages that can be cached...<br />
The beauty of this solution is that websites that get a lot of traffic (and thus comments) will be able to spread their ping images amongst many browsers. </p>

<p>(1) spam pings:<br />
We will probably present our idea of authentication implementation in v0.4 of the specification. We know that it is a serious problem, but we're lucky that there were other people, like you, thinking about this problem, before. We'll try to find the best solution for all.</p>

<p>(2) minimal ping via images:<br />
Interesting, we also had a resmbling idea. The problem is: What about pages that don't really have visitors? What you describe is like "outsourcing" cronjobs to visitors, it only works if there are visitors. Not a good solution for a mechanism that perhaps should be used by many many webloggers out there, we thought. </p>

<p>The problem isn't to transfer the data, that doesn't need much time and work. The problem is that you have to get a connection to the server to transfer data at all. And when servers are slow or even offline you even cannot send a small ping but have to wait until the connection-try timeouts. Large comment-threads could have severeal hundered URIs to ping. Wait 150 connections to time out really is no fun.</p>

<p>Perhaps we found another solution for the pingproblem, in the background I'm just testing it. We'll see...</p>
