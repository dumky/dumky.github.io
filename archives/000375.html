<h2 class="title">Prediction vs Explanation</h2>

<p>I can't get this excellent <a href="http://daviddfriedman.blogspot.com/2008/09/prediction-vs-explanation-puzzle.html">reasoning question</a> by David Friedman out of my head: </p>

<p><img src="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/images/bayes.jpg" style="float: right; padding: 10px 0px 0px 20px; width:150; height:150; border: none"  alt="Thomas Bayes" /> <blockquote>We do ten experiments. A scientist observes the results, constructs a theory consistent with them, and uses it to predict the results of the next ten. We do them and the results fit his predictions. A second scientist now constructs a theory consistent with the results of all twenty experiments.</p>

<p>The two theories give different predictions for the next experiment. Which do we believe [more]? Why?</blockquote></p>

<p>My intuition is that we should believe the first theory more. Making a successful and surprising prediction makes a theory more plausible. The second theory also makes a successful "prediction" of the second set of results but it is not surprising (since those results were already factored into that theory). So I think the second theory has greater risk of over-fitting.<br />
But somehow I can't manage to formalize this reasoning. <br />
Also, I find it strange that this apparently simple problem was not addressed in the books I read on probability theory.</p>

<p>There were a few different attempts on <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/ud/friedmans_prediction_vs_explanation/ ">this thread</a>, but none seems quite successful.<br />
I see how other factors such as the skills of the scientists and the priors of both theories (Occam's Razor) could come into play. <br />
But I hope that a formal analysis would isolate the "prediction vs explanation" factor.</p>
