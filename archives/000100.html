<p>A nice <a href="http://manufacturing.stanford.edu/">online course</a> that goes over many aspects of manufacturing. It was posted on slashdot <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/08/29/1817250">a couple of days back</a>.<br />
How are M&Ms coated? How are glass bottles molded? How do you put stuffing in chocolates?</p>

<p>I was surprised by the lack of reaction by slashdot readers (few comments). Although I've had some experience in manufacturing, what striked me in the course was how different software is. </p>

<p>I also recommend the excellent <a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/">HowStuffWorks site</a>.</p>
