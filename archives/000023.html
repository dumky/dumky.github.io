<p>Ever felt emails dictate your day and keep interrupting your programming?<br />
Here is a small piece on <a href="http://www.w-uh.com/articles/030308-tyranny_of_email.html">the Tyranny of Email</a>.</p>
<p>The next version of Outlook introduces a new type of toast, that is half transparent and displays the title of the email for a short while. It seems better than the folder icon in the system tray (that appears when emails have arrived) but I am not sure yet whether it'll make keeping the email client constantly opened a managable option.</p>

<p>I just started using a Outlook little trick to be notified with a sound only by some threads that are blocking me and that I am waiting an answer on.<br />
I simply add a tag (<i>notify:myusername</i>) at the bottom of the email before I send it on the thread and Outlook picks it up when somebody replies because of a specific rule. The rule just states "if an email arrives and the body contains this tag, play a sound".<br />
This way, I don't have to keep checking the emails I receive when I expect a response.</p>

<p>I think IM also has this problem to a certain extent. The first thing you need to do when you use MS Messenger is turn off the sounds and most of the toasts ("friend is now online",...).</p>

<p>I'm also having trouble with my project's build and deployment process. It takes too long (a couple minutes for build and the same for deployment) and I can't change the code during this time, if I want to debug what I just built. So I usually browse (or sometimes check my mail), but then I loose some of my focus. My solution to this is online bookmarks: it's just a <a href="http://enotes.monstuff.com/bookmarks.php?user=dumky">one-pager stack of links</a> where I store everything I want to give a look at later. This way I just give a quick look at slashdot or other sites, find cool links and stack them (using a bookmarklet and a customized version of Phoenix) without getting myself too randomized.</p>

<p>Here is an <a href="http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2002/12/26/inroom_chat.html">interesting social experiment</a> to deal with interruptions during meetings. A parallel discussion is established through an online chat, that also gets displayed on a large screen for people to follow without being stuck on their laptops.<br />
As this <a href="http://oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3010">O'Reilly Network blog</a> mentions, a RendezVous enabled IRC program would be nice. It would also be a nice alternative to the web chat program used during this experiment.</p>
