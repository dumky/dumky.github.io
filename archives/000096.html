<p>Via <a href="http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/432/432717p1.html">IGN</a>, Hyperion apparently is being considered for a Hollywood conversion. I'll be waiting for these, as I was waiting for the Lord of the Rings.<br />
For those who haven't read this <a href="http://www.dansimmons.com/">Dan Simmons'</a> book, it is one of the greatest Sci-Fi books ever. I strongly recommend it. It is composed of four volumes (<i>Hyperion</i>, <i>The Fall of Hyperion</i>, <i>Endymion</i> and <i>The Rise of Endymion</i>).</p>

<p><i>Carrion Comfort</i> and <i>Children of the Night</i>, from the same author, are also great books, but with a horror component (vampires).</p>

<p><u>Update:</u> A <a href="http://www.dansimmons.com/news/movies.htm#hyperionnew">confirmation</a> of the Hyperion movie rumors.</p>
