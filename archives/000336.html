<ol><li>Install the <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/images/Flickr - Single Page Results.user.js">"Flickr - Single Page Results"</a> script (requires <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748">Greasemonkey</a> for Firefox) </li><li>Search for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=something">something</a> on Flickr </li><li>Scroll down the page </li><li>Continue scrolling down the page </li><li>Repeat step 4 as much as you need ;-) </li></ol>
Beware, this is rather hypnotic and makes Flickr really addictive.

<p>Recently, I have been fishing for images from Flickr to include in my blog posts. And it is clear that turning pages gets in the way.</p>

<p>Luckily, there is an "endless scrolling" AJAX technique. Live.com tried it for its image results, instead of chunking them. It was <a href="http://humanized.com/weblog/2006/05/04/no_more_more_pages_part_2/">discussed on the Humanized blog</a> and implemented in the Humanized Blog Reader.</p>

<p>This script here implements the same feature for the Flickr search results. </p>

<p>Note that this works best if you scroll down the page using the keyboard, rather than the scrollbar.<br />
Also, I did not implement any kind of landmark or bookmarkability support (using the url hash).</p>

<p>The script is based off my previous "Single Page View" scripts (IGN, ArsTechnica, ACMQueue), but is a bit simpler and should be easier to adapt to other sites. </p>
