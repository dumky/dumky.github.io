<p>A list of <a href="http://eberhard-lutz.bei.t-online.de/classics.html">classical computer science texts</a>. Lots of good reading.<br />
Amongst others, it links to "The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine" from the Google founders, "Go To Statement Considered Harmful" from Dijkstra, and Knuth's "Computer Programming as an Art".</p>

<p>The link for <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Library/Magazine/Vol12/12-04/Abstracts/aimag12-04-007.html">Bayesian Networks without Tears</a> was broken, but it wasn't much of a challenge for Google.</p>
