<p>Here's <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/images/XMLHttpRequestDebugging.v1.2.user.js" title="right click &#8594; Install User Script...">XmlHttpRequest - Debugging (version 1.2)</a>, an update on the <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/000252.html">original</a>.<br />
The script now works in Firefox 1.5 with Greasemonkey 0.6.4. </p>

<p>Thanks to the readers who reported the problem for their help and patience.</p>
<p> <br />
The problem was caused by Greasemonkey's new injection system, which doesn't allow the userscript to access the XMLHttpRequest object in the page anymore.</p>

<p>As a workaround, the script escapes the Greasemonkey sandbox by eval'ing itself in the context of the page. <br />
On the downside, it means that the injected code loses the ability to call Greasemonkey functions such as GM_getValue, GM_setValue or GM_registerMenuCommand. This means that the console won't remember its state (position, settings,...) between page loads and I also had to disable the "hide" functionality.<br />
 <br />
Here's the essence of the change:<br />
<div class="code">function injectMe() {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;... original userscript ...<br />
}<br />
unsafeWindow.eval(injectMe.toString());<br />
unsafeWindow.eval("injectMe();");<br />
</div></p>

<p><u>Update (2005/01/12):</u> According to Aaron Boodman (Greasemonkey creator) on the mailing list, unsafeWindow.XMLHttpRequest should still be available from the userscript. I'll investigate a bit more, but at least the script is working again now.</p>

<p><u>Update (2005/05/12):</u> I just <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/000291.html">ported this script to IE</a>, using a bookmarklet.</p>

This seems to be a problem with Greasemonkey itself. I googled the error you pasted ("Config is not defined") and found some info on the Greaseblog. I didn't get the time to go through the details, but I think you'll find some tips on fixing this there.</p>

<p>Firefox 1.5.0.2<br />
Greasemonkey 0.6.4</p>

<p>When I attempt to install XmlHttpRequest - Debugging (version 1.2), I get an alert:</p>

<p>Error installing user script:<br />
[Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80520012 (NS_ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND) [nsIChannel.open]" nsresult: "0x80520012 (NS_FILE_NOT_FOUND)" location: "JS frame :: chrome://greasemonkey/content/utils.js :: getContents :: line 167" data: no]</p>

<p>Any ideas as to what is wrong?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I've installed greasemonkey.</p>

<p>I'm using Firefox 1.5.0.6.</p>

<p>When I enter a website to monitor and navigate to the site, the debugging screen pops up, but nothing ever happens when I enter search criteria (ex: www.google.com/webhp).</p>
