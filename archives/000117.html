<p>Although they are a bit of a time hog, I love playing games ;-)<br />
The demo of <a href="http://www.trackmaniagame.com/">Trackmania (PC)</a> came out recently. It's a pretty original car game, were you not only race through crazy circuits (remember <a href="http://www.simracingworld.com/content/193/">Stunt Car Racer</a> on Atari?) but you also have to construct the circuits themselves. The challenge is to build the most optimized circuit, given a limited number of pieces, and expertly drive through it to beat the clock.</p>

<p>A friend of mine bought <a href="http://www.konami.com/ddrmax2/">Dance Dance Revolution Max 2 (PS2)</a> with the dance pads. It's really fun to play with a bunch of friends and it's great exercise too. The only trouble is if you live in an apartment  with neighbors below you ;-)</p>

<p>Much more relaxing, a <a href="http://snowflakes.lookandfeel.com/">paper snowflake making tool</a> (via <a href="http://www.nedbatchelder.com/blog/200310.html#e20031030T185637">Ned's blog</a>). It's a nicely designed Flash app that allows you to cut virtual paper, make snowflake-like shapes and post them to a gallery. </p>

<p><u>Update:</u> There is now a <a href="http://www.trackmania-lejeu.com/img/trackmania.htm">trailer for the full Trackmania game</a>. Looks like tons of fun, check it out.</p>

<p><u>Update:</u> Dance Dance Revolution is now available on PC via a Python port: <a href="http://www.icculus.org/pyddr/">PyDDR</a>. You can even plug the PS2 dance mats via an USB adapater ;-)</p>
