<p>Check out this <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/5/15/22352/6060">witty review of the Matrix Reloaded</a> on Kuro5hin.<br />
I agree with some of the comments: the sequel doesn't compare to the original, especially because the dialogs aren't snappy enough and the Zion scenes don't bring much. The hype and high expectations certainly don't help either.<br />
But it is still a good movie. The fight scenes are great, and I liked the Oracle scene and following encounter with Agent Smith as the dialogs' quality is closer to the original's.</p>
