<p>Here is one more <a href="http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2003/03/10/collections.html">nice design discussion from O'Reilly Network</a> about building type-safe arrays and hashtables on top of the type-unsafe implementations provided by the framework.<br />
All the solutions evaluated have some issues, and generic types are mentioned as a solution.</p>

<p>For other angles on type safety and genericity:<br />
- <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/">O'Caml</a> is a safe and strongly typed language with polymorphic inferred types.<br />
- Microsoft Research has a <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/projects/clrgen/">.NET Generics project</a>. Apparently, the next version of C# may include Generics, as mentioned in this <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/csharp/learn/Future/VCS%20Language%20Changes.aspx">GotDotNet article on future C# features</a>. This article also mentions Iterators, Anonymous methods and Partial types.<br />
- Here is a <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/projects/ilx/">partial .NET implementation of O'Caml</a>, called F#, by Microsoft Research.</p>
