<p>I was trying to introduce Bruce Schneier and his books to my fiancee the other day, and specifically how his point of view evolved from book to book. <br />
In <a href="http://www.schneier.com/book-applied.html">"Applied Cryptography"</a>, the best introduction and technical reference on the subject (concepts, algorithms and protocols), cryptography appears as the stronghold of security. <br />
The following <a href="http://www.schneier.com/book-sandl.html">"Secrets and Lies"</a> <a href="http://www.schneier.com/book-sandl-msg.html">makes a big turn</a> by realizing how cryptography isn't the ultimate and binary solution to security, which can be sprinkled here and there. Instead security is viewed as a process, where knowledge of the system as a whole and the derived threats (via threat modeling) is key to successful and managed security.</p>

<p>His latest book, <a href="http://www.schneier.com/book-beyondfear.html">"Beyond Fear"</a>, this same approach of lucid examination is applied to real-world security, as opposed to electronic security. It invites the reader to train his critical thinking by analyzing examples of mitigations that actually create worse side-effects and are decided on politics and public perception rather than a rigorous security analysis. </p>

<p>Schneier's latest articles, from <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/">his blog</a> and <a href="http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram.html">his Crypto-Gram newsletter</a>, provide examples of assessing the effectiveness of some measures like <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2004/10/do_terror_alert.html">terrorism security alerts and levels in the US</a> and the importance of training (vs. emotions) on security-related decisions (see <a href="http://www.schneier.com/essay-050.html">Bomb scare on airplane, caused by "BOB" inscription</a>).</p>

Also on the topic of emotions and our decision process, Gladwell has a great article about <a href="http://www.gladwell.com/2004/2004_01_12_a_suv.html">SUVs, safety and the perception thereof</a> (<a href="http://www.practicalmetaphors.com/archives/000057.html">via</a>).</p>

<p>I agree that security is a process. After all, attackers go for the weakest link, not the stongest ones. </p>

<p>You might employ killer encryption algorithms in one place, but leave some other critical path unguarded.</p>

<p>This "Beyond Fear" book sounds interesting, especially in light of all the airline security issues, etc.<br />
