<p>The <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/images/AddTorrentsToABC.user.js" title="right click &#8594; Install User Script...">"Add Torrent to ABC"</a> userscript makes it easy to start a torrent download on a remote machine. <br />
It simply adds an icon link next to the torrent links that it can identify. That link uses a web interface of the ABC bittorrent client to start the remote download. </p>

<p>I'm using <a href="http://www.swiftlytilting.com/phpabc/">phpABC</a> for the web interface, since <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/000194.html">PHP-4-ABC</a> is not maintained anymore (I had to tweak it to make it work with ABC 3.0. A simple password protection achieves the level of security I need. <br />
The userscript is configured with the url of my home machine and you will need to modify it with your own url before using the script.</p>
<p> <br />
<b>Update (2006/03/09):</b> This script combines nicely with the <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/3045">Rotten Tomatoes to Torrents linker</a> script.</p>

<p>What did you have to change to make it work with ABC 3.0?  phpABC should work fine 'out of the box'..</p>

<p>cheers for the greasemonkey script</p>

<p>Frantik, I had to modify PHP-4-ABC to run with ABC 3.0, but phpABC ran fine.</p>
