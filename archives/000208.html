<p>Following <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/">Dare</a>'s advice, I modified my <a href="/index.xml">RSS 2.0 feed</a> to contain the full-text of entries. The Atom feed already did.<br />
A downside is that with the extended entry now part of the feed, I won't be able to make small updates without annoying people. But most aggregators offer the option to ignore these changes, so things should work out.</p>

<p>I also reduced the number of entries in the feeds to 5 since I don't post very frequently. <br />
One thing that I haven't managed is using HTTP/gzip compression, because I'm not hosting at home anymore, I'm not sure that my provider supports mod_gzip and I want to keep my feeds static.</p>
