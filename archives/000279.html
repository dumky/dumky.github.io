<h2 class="title">Comment Tracking with coComment</h2>

<p>Tracking the comments I leave at other people's blogs have been a <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/000206.html">long time problem for me</a>. And it looks like many bloggers have the same problem.</p>

<p>One item on my todo list (that I didn't get to) has been to write a Greasemonkey script that would log my comments using Gmail (building on top of my <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/000238.html">"Mailto Compose In GMail" userscript</a>). But proper comment form detection was an obvious difficulty. </p>

<p>A new service has appeared, <a href="http://www.cocomment.com/">coComment</a>, which solved that issue, allowing you to effectively track your comments. <br />
It works by injecting some javascript into any page with a comment form, so that your submission gets logged onto their server in the background. This modification of the form can be done using a bookmarklet (don't forget to click it before submitting your comment) or a <a href="http://www.solutionwatch.com/313/comment-tracking-with-cocomment/">Greasemonkey scripts</a>. <br />
It is able to recognize comment forms from various blogging tools, by having some specific code for each platform it <a href="http://www.cocomment.com/supported">supports</a> (Blogger, MovableType, ...). I wonder if a microformat could get any traction in standardizing comment forms a bit more.</p>

<a name="more"></a>
<p> <br />
The Greasemonkey script is much more convenient than the bookmarklet, since it removes the manual step. For non-Greasemonkey and IE/Safari/... users, I'm sure that equivalent functionality will soon appear in the form of browser extensions. </p>

<p>Kudos to the coComment team. I'm sure we'll hear more from their product as it  makes the rounds.</p>

There is not problem with tracking scripts but it is also open to abuse by others if any of these scripts have a flaw, as there always are. It brings up privacy/security issues again if not secure.</p>
