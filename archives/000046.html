<p>This was listed on Slashdot, but in case you haven't seen it, check out this <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3046791.stm">BBC News article</a>. The article suggests the illusion is very effective on people, I really wish I could see this live.<br />
I wonder whether a circular one (instead of square shaped) would work: are the bubbles going to have nice and circular upward flow under a helix?</p>

<p>In the same "air and water tricks" spirit, dolphins are able to make <a href="http://www.earthtrust.org/delrings.html">air rings underwater</a>. They are similar to smoke rings that some smokers do.<br />
The really cool <a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/">Exploratorium in San Francisco</a> has demonstrations of these, where you can pump to air into a water tank to make these vortexes.</p>

<p>Some toys that make vortexes:<br />
The <a href="http://www.zerotoys.com/">Zero Blaster</a> is a toy to make smoke rings.<br />
The <a href="http://www.airzooka.net">Air Zooka</a> is another toy that relies on the same  phenomena to throw packed air.</p>

<p>Update: Another water illusion based on a simple principle: the <a href="http://www.laser-magic.com/AGWF.html">anti-gravity waterfall</a>, with water droplets that appear to fall upwards.</p>
