<p>I just decided to try the latest XP Tablet PC updates (part of XP SP2) again. The install went fine. As when I installed the beta of Lonestar, I'm still not that impressed with the changes, although the new wireless networking dialogs are nice and I was expecting a lot from the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/tabletpc/evaluation/overviews/pctools.mspx#EDAA">new input panel (TIP)</a>. <br />
It's because the application I use the most, Firefox, doesn't work properly with this in-context TIP.</p>

<p>I found some reports of the same problem on the <a href="http://www.tabletpcbuzz.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=15695">Tablet PC Buzz</a> and <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=91729&highlight=sp2+tip">Mozillazine  </a> forums. There is also a tracking <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=244119">bug in Bugzilla</a>.</p>

<p>Jim Hurd wrote an <a href="http://tabletpcbuzz.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=17826">extension</a> to solve this. Here's the <a href="http://www.datagrove.com/tpctip.xpi">direct link to tpctip.xpi</a>, you'll need to save it locally before installing it, as clicking the link doesn't trigger the XPI installer.<br />
Although the extension does make the floating TIP appear when the url bar has the focus, it's not quite usable yet (compared to IE): the history completion drop-down interacts badly with the TIP (the drop-down comes in front of the TIP and/or the TIP closes itself) and the TIP is not in the URL mode.</p>

<p>Looks like Firefox users will have to stick with the locked TIP at the bottom of the screen for a bit longer...</p>

More <a href="http://www.seizetheworkday.com/ChapterUpdates.htm">info on the new TIP features</a>.</p>
<p> <br />
<u>Update:</u> Loren points out a very interesting limitation of the SP2 TIP: although it can adjust to the context of input fields and you can configure this context by tagging the inputs, that <a href="http://journals.tuxreports.com/lch/archives/002148.html">doesn't work with web page input fields</a>. </p>
