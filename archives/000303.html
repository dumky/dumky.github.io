<p>Check out the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=if3Qv2tHyfA">trailer video of Portal</a> on YouTube (or a <a href="http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/11384/HalfLife-2-Portal-Teaser-Trailer-in-High-Definition/">hi-def</a> version), an upcoming mini-game from Valve. It's an innovative first-person platformer that integrates the concept of portals to extend a traditional puzzle gameplay. <br />
The goal of the game is to escape from an experimental maze, by leveraging a device that can create two connected portals onto most surfaces (walls, floor and ceiling).</p>

<p>It turns out that some students made a prototype of this concept, as part of a game class project at DigiPen. The resulting game, <a href="http://www.nuclearmonkeysoftware.com/narbaculardrop.html ">Narbacular Drop</a>, is available for download along with some challenging <a href="http://www.nuclearmonkeysoftware.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=198">custom maps</a>.<br />
Apparently, Valve hired the entire team after seeing the prototype.</p>

<p>Narbacular Drop already demonstrates most of the cool features shown in the Portal trailer. Although playing it made me feel dizzy at moments, it's worth trying. <br />
Portal will use the Source engine that Half-Life 2 is built on, so it will have great graphics and solid physics, as you can see in some additional <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgPIGCmLjbA">in-game footage</a>. I'm really impatient for its release (packaged with Half-Life 2: Episode 2, on PC, XBOX 360 and PS3).</p>

<p>Nice concept. The half life physics engine would make it worth the $$. Any idea if it would run on PSP?</p>

<p>I haven't heard of any PSP plans. <br />
But since Narbacular Drop is already lots of fun, even with simpler graphics, I don't see what would prevent PSP or even Xbox or PS2 versions of this concept.</p>

<p>I love the way this game is set up, should be interesting to see just how many levels it has to play.Really awsome trailer for the game , the marketing team should get a bonus for putting together this footage.</p>
