<p>Applications are still largely designed to be independent from each other. But it is clear that we multitask more and more.<br />
The question is, how can software help use manage our activities better?</p>

<p><h4>Queues</h4> Queues, in my opinion, are one of the keys to solving the overload mess. As <a href="http://al3x.net/2008/12/22/life-as-queues.html">Alex Payne</a> remarks, we deal with remarkable number of queues on a daily basis: communications awaiting attention and reply, work and home tasks, various reading (books, bookmarks, ...), movies to watch, things to see, places to visit, thoughts to be refined...<br />
But how to manage all those queues without adding another queuing system and spending our time keeping up-to-date ;-)</p>

<p>A good queue system should, I think, include some form of active monitoring: a movie I'm interested in is now showing or available on DVD, a book is available on Kindle, a good deal comes up for a restaurant or a trip.</p>

<p><h4>Multiple devices</h4> In the case of media (bookmarks, PDFs, podcasts, youtube videos, etc.), we should have better apps for managing those queues. Things become especially difficult when you start crossing device boundaries: from computer to handheld devices to TV. <br />
I haven't seen a solution which doesn't frustrate you with unnecessary administrative waste: to delete or archive a video after watching it, for queuing on one device, then downloading and consuming on another, or for annotating and re-finding stuff.<br />
A good model would allow different workflows, synchronize across devices and deal with intermittent or scarce connections.</p>

<p><h4>Videos</h4> The shift to more video and audio content becoming available online, also provides some new challenges. But these screencasts, presentations, and various clips are simultaneously long and hard to multitask.<br />
It would be great if the OS or the browser could help manage and facilitate watching videos. <br />
For example, if you could queue a video to be watched on another device (would require a way to extract and address videos). <br />
Or if you could clip a video from one tab and make it into a side bar (any idea whether a Firefox add-on could implement that?).<br />
Another idea would be to allow user-contributed video highlights (for presentations and such), to share condensed videos with other users.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
I'm curious to try Windows 7, as it offers some incremental solutions for this kind of activities, such as the new taskbar ("superbar") and the side-by-side windows seem useful. This kind of thinking will definitely help make it successful, as there is a clear need for better multitasking.</p>
