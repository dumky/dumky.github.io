<p>Here's my latest Greasemonkey user script: <a title="right click &#8594; Install User Script..." href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/images/ACMQueueSinglePageView.user.js">ACM Queue - Single Page View</a>.</p>

<p>Many of the ACM Queue articles are formatted into multiple pages. Even their printer-friendly versions are not single page.<br />
This script fixes that by combining all the pages for a given article into a single view. The <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/images/acmqueue-singlepageview.jpg">resulting view (screenshot)</a> has as much cruft removed as possible, to let you focus on the content.</p>
<p>IGN.com is probably a bit more complex in terms of screen scraping, but it'd be another great candidate for a similar page re-formatter (that would generate single page views for the articles and reviews). Anyone up for it?</p>
