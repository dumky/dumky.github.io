<p><a href="http://data-pod.com/">DataPod</a> seems very promising. It is a peer to peer synchronizing folder, oriented towards businesses.<br />
It is still in beta stage and was presented at <a href="http://www.demo.com/demo/demonstrators/2004/page773-716359.html">DEMO 2004</a>.</p>

<p>Here is another <a href="http://www.nwfusion.com/columnists/2004/0216cooltools.html">short description</a>. It mentions multiple subscriptions options (monthly, yearly and lifetime). <br />
On the other hand, this <a href="http://www.pocketpcthoughts.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=215920&sid=43f86adc5f51417ae156afa3a961e9d0">other article</a> reports a fixed 70-100$ price, and the discussion thread lists some other folder synchronization products: <a href="http://ifolderdemo.novell.com/iFolder/">iFolder</a> and <a href="http://www.fusionone.com/products/con_f1.htm">FusionOne</a>.</p>
