<p>Here's <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/images/XMLHttpRequestDebugging.v1.1.user.js" title="right click &#8594; Install User Script...">XmlHttpRequest - Debugging (version 1.1)</a>, an update on the <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/000252.html">original</a>.</p>

<p>The fixed bug: onreadystatechange callbacks weren't getting triggered properly. The reason was the native XmlHttpRequest object doesn't call onreadystatechange if it also has an onload callback. The replacement onload handler now calls any onload and onreadystatechange callback from the user, emulating the same logic. </p>

<p><u>Update (2006/02/20):</u> A <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/000274.html">newer version</a> is available, supporting Firefox 1.5 with Greasemonkey 0.6.4.</p>

<p>I've tried to install this script on three different machines, all running the latest version of XP, with Greasemonkey 0.5.3 and Firefox 1.0.7.  In every case, sadly, I get the menu item "User Script Commands" greyed out. There's no javascript error, so I'm really puzzled. Why does this clearly work so well for others, yet on three different Windows machines it won't work for me? </p>

<p>Hey I cannot get it to work. The window pops up when I call the ajax enabled page. The script does not work, and I get nothing on the window either. The 'User Script Commands' is greyed out too</p>

<p>I cannot get this to work for the life of me, I've tried it locally, on digg, gmail, google maps, etc. The div comes up, I cannot move it and it doesn't record any of the request/responses.</p>

<p>I noticed in my javascript console it keeps saying "XMLHttpRequest has no properties", on lines 12 and 48. </p>

<p>I still cannot get this script working or the one you wrote that just writes to the console. Would love to get this puppy workin ;)</p>

<p>Great tool! I'm using it to debug a site and it seems to duplicate my ajax postings. I have a button that adds another element. with this script activated, it makes two elements, etc.</p>

<p>Is that a me thing?</p>

<p>I'm getting this to work great on my local machine, but when I publish it to the server, it blows up at dojo.flash.comm.XmlHttp. If I display dojo.flash.comm, it is there with a list of methods, but XmlHttp isn't one of them. Any idea why it would not have this method?</p>

<p>Thanks for any help/ideas.</p>
