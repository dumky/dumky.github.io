<p>Via <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/08/05.html#a4166">Scoble</a>, a new Powertoy is available for Tablet PCs: a <a href="http://www.shahine.com/omar/PermaLink.aspx/6258ada1-e5e6-4af8-a8c3-824abf472302">dictionary manager</a>. You can download it from the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/tabletpc/downloads/powertoys.asp">Tablet PC Powertoys page</a>.</p>

<p>Note that you might need to install the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/tpcsdk10/html/gettingstarted/tbconwhatsnew.asp">Tablet PC SDK 1.5</a>. Otherwise you get all sorts of non-meaningful exception messages.</p>

<p>I only have half a dozen words in there for now, but I'll add more as they come. These words are now recognized correctly. <br />
As Christopher commented, now what is needed is some training. In my case, my 'I's are never recognized...</p>

<p>You should not need to installt the 1.5 SDK. The MSI installer for this powertoy should install the necessary components for you.</p>

<p>Also I have found that the accuracy of recognizing an "I" improves if you just enter that letter in the Dictionary tool.</p>

<p>Thanks for the correction. <br />
My mention of the 1.5 SDK problem was because I read some people having problems with it and your tool, but I didn't have this problem myself. Also, from my experience, when the 1.5 SDK is required but missing, the error messages are pretty bad ;-)<br />
It's good to know your msi handles the issue.</p>

<p>I'll definitely try adding the 'I'.<br />
Cheers and thanks again for this nifty tool.</p>
