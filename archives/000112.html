<p>... is up on MSDN.<br />
The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/">MSDN site on Longhorn</a> now how some articles, along with an RSS feed. It also has some Longhorn SDK/documentation.</p>

<p><u>Update:</u> A bunch of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc/agendaandsessions/sessions/default.aspx">PDC slides</a> are now available.</p>

<p>Although lots of stuff in Longhorn does seem exciting, I don't really like the PDC/Longhorn (over)hype, mostly because:</p>
<p>- 2006 is far away, <br />
- it doesn't seem that ground-breaking compared to the competition,<br />
- why do a bundled late release rather than upgrade various components separately (IE, .NET/winforms, NGSCB, ...)?<br />
- I expected things like XAML in v1 winforms or at least in .NET 2.0 (release Whidbey), and similar solutions exist in other projects (XUL, thinlets, Glade), <br />
- filesystem indexing and support for extensible and flexible metadata is already quite advanced on Linux,<br />
- Apple already has a powerful rendering engine and some Linux project have extensive support for vector graphics.</p>

<p>This is a bit of a reduction of course, there is plenty of interesting things coming up in Longhorn. I am just not convinced they justify the hype, the bundled late release and MS re-inventing proprietary solutions instead of using more open and standard ones (msbuild, xaml, wvg, ...).<br />
But having these technologies shipped in the dominant desktop OS definitely opens doors for interesting developments, especially in managed code.</p>

<p>Sometimes I just wonder what the situation would look like if Microsoft had be broken down into smaller companies by the monopoly trial. Instead of having tightly integrated products (without a clear benefit imho), we might have a great MS browser, more open protocols and a less centralized control.</p>
