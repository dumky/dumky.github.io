<p>The CodeProject article, <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/aspnet/AspxProtocol.asp">"A Simple protocol to view aspx pages without IIS implemented in C#"</a>, is intriguing.<br />
It uses a custom protocol handler (aspx:) that instanciates the ASP.NET runtime, sends it the request and reads the response back to IE, allowing to test aspx files without a web server.</p>

<p>The web.config and global.asax are searched back to the root in the file path.</p>

<p>There are some limitations like problems with cookies and mime-type headers. Also you probably need to be careful not to jump out of aspx: back to the http: protocol.<br />
I'm not sure whether the HttpRuntime is instanciated at every request or if a trick is used to make it stay alive in the background (required to maintain session state).</p>
<p>Another article on <a href="http://www.west-wind.com/presentations/aspnetruntime/aspnetruntime.asp">instanciating the HttpRuntime</a> for use on the desktop.</p>
