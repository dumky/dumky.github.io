<p>Not many technologies have managed to bridge the digital gap, like barcodes have. There is a couple of projects that aim to extend this type of real world / digital world binding and interaction, beyond warehouse management. The ones below seem to have potential, as they try to empower the user and not just deliver more ads...</p>

<p>I mentioned <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/000103.html">digitally signed ID cards with a barcode</a> in an earlier post. <a href="http://www.parc.com/research/asd/projects/dataglyphs/">Dataglyphs</a> are a PARC Research's solution to embed barcodes within images themselves. And the <a href="http://semacode.org/">Sem@code</a> project build barcodes that encode urls and are readable using a cellphone's camera, which seems to overcome one of the main reasons the CueCat failed (it needed a computer and a wired device).</p>

<p>Some "bridging" technologies, like RFIDs, use radio frequencies to link the item and the device. <a href="http://www.ntag.com/">nTag</a> and <a href="http://www.shockfish.com/">SpotMe</a> are devices that use wireless technologies to enrich some social scenarios, like conferences. I'd be curious to read some users' feedback on these.<br />
There is also a bunch of location-aware products that are emerging (mostly phone based), but it is also hard to tell how useful they really could be, without seeing them in action.</p>

<p><u>Update:</u> Slashdot has a <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/11/16/0538227">story on nTags</a>.</p>
<p><u>Update:</u> Another cool use of barcodes with cellphones: the cellphone analyses the position of a circular barcode on a screen and transmits that information via bluetooth, to provide a new form of input mechanism. <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/05/27/1849209">Slashdot's "Cellphone as Virtual Mouse, Keyboard"</a> and the research page on these <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/uid/spotcode.html">SpotCodes</a> (with videos).<br />

<p><u>Update:</u> Barcode references on an empty miniature railroad track create an augmented reality world with <a href="http://studierstube.org/invisible_train/">virtual trains</a> (via <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/invisible-train-022320.php">gizmodo</a>), when viewed through camera-enabled PDAs.</p>

<p><u>Update (2005/12/28): </u> <a href="http://www.semapedia.org/">Semapedia</a> is a Semacode to Wikipedia linking solution. It provides both label printing so that you can tag physical objects and a reader software for mobile phones.</p>
