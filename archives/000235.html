<h2 class="title">BoingBoing Ad Remover</h2>

<p>BoingBoing was <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/03/14/butler_rewrites_goog.html">just pointing</a> at Mark Pilgrim's <a href="http://diveintomark.org/projects/butler/">Google Butler</a>, which strips Google ads and adds a number of useful features.<br />
Since I was just posting about the <a href="/archives/000230.html">coming conflicts around ad-filtering</a>, I wanted to have some fun throwing oil onto the fire, as well as experiment with the <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">Greasemonkey</a> extension for Firefox. So here is <a title="right click &#8594; Install User Script..." href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/images/BoingBoingButler.user.js">"BoingBoing Butler"</a> (requires Greasemonkey), which hides all non-content from BoingBoing. </p>

<p>While I'm at it, here's a some challenges to Greasemonkey hackers: <br />
<ul><li>Could we use this to bring Google auto-completion to the main Google search page? or add more integration between the various Google services (search, mail, maps,...)? </li><li>Could this be used to create some in-page annotation using del.icio.us or wikis? or would javascript/domain restrictions prevent that? </li><li>Create an easy way to find Greasemonkey scripts for a site that you're at. It would search, list and describe all the useful customizations that you could apply to the site. Can this be done by re-using the existing search engines, using a distributed approach (FOAF, a file type or a standard url format?), instead of creating a dedicated directory site with a "search by site" functionality? </li></ul></p>

<p>And also some questions: <br />
<ul><li>How to avoid the blinking effect, as the sidebars are loaded and then hidden? Is it cleaner to completely remove the elements from the DOM, rather than using CSS to hide them? </li><li>Those user scripts are completely unsecure, aren't they? Any of them could include some spyware/adware script to phone home (log the websites that I visit) or display ads, is that right? </li></ul></p>

<a name="more"></a>
<p><u>Update (2005/03/15):</u> There is already a user script to do <a href="http://www.hackdiary.com/src/pips.user.js">cross-site integration with del.icio.us</a> (for the BBC 3 Radio website). It uses XMLHttpRequest, but requires bypassing some security restrictions using Firefox's prefs.js. Here's <a href="http://www.hackdiary.com/archives/000067.html">more info</a>.</p>

<p>Alf Eaton wrote a little demo <a href="http://hublog.hubmed.org/archives/001088.html">spyware user script</a>. It steals the users cookies. It could as well snoop the user's password...<br />
Like <a href="http://youngpup.net/2005/0312020356">Aaron</a> I don't see any trivial fix to this problem.</p>

<p>Good catch, I never went to the archives. And I couldn't see the top banner, because it was already AdBlocked.</p>

<p>Both of these seem tricky to target and hide. The banner  don't have any specific ID, CLASS or NAME attribute. Same thing with the sidebar on the right, for the archives page.<br />

<p>"Could we use this to bring Google auto-completion to the main Google search page? or add more integration between the various Google services (search, mail, maps,...)?"</p>

<p>yes, quite easily. should be as simple as grabbing the existing script, throwing it into a .user.js file, and making a few dom-edits.</p>

<p><br />
"Could this be used to create some in-page annotation using del.icio.us or wikis? or would javascript/domain restrictions prevent that?"</p>

<p>An upcoming GM version will have a way around the domain restrictions. It could be done today if either of those services provided a javascript-style API to their service ala Google Suggest (because javascript files are not subjected to the same-domain policy the way XML files are).</p>

<p>"Create an easy way to find GreaseMonkey scripts for a site that you're at. It would search, list and describe all the useful customizations that you could apply to the site. Can this be done by re-using the existing search engines, using a distributed approach (FOAF, a file type or a standard url format?), instead of creating a dedicated directory site with a "search by site" functionality? "</p>

<p>I wanted to do this originally by file type, but none of the major search engines can find ".user.js" files because they are overwhelmed by references to the user.js file that is part of mozilla. Unfortunate. </p>

<p>Jeremy dunck, who created the Greasemonkey archive wiki, wants to extend it so that people can thumb-up or thumb-down scripts. This could help head-off possible XSS security problems.</p>

<p>We'll have to do something like this at some point, I'd imagine.</p>

<p>I think you'd need to have a dedicated directory site *somewhere*, but it could be something as simple as <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/greasemonkey+[sitename],">http://del.icio.us/tag/greasemonkey+[sitename],</a> if that were an agreeable convention.</p>

<p>Contrary to Pedro's rather *rude* comments -- I think Xeni's posts are quite excellent. I believe an apology is in order.</p>

<p>However, with regards to content, perhaps it might be more resource-optimal to parse and strip adds from the RSS feed, and then rebuild the content, instead of stripping stuff directly from the HTML page.</p>

<p>At the *very* least, you'd be saving the authors a bunch of bandwidth, which is the real reason for the ads in the first place...I mean, removing ads are fine as a technical tour-de-force, but you must realize that you are effectively preventing Cory from recieving advertising revenue and effectively styming him from keeping the site alive -- I mean, consider what Cory would have to do if every single BB reader decided to do this?</p>

Do you think that Mark's "Google Butler", that BoingBoing was advertising and which removes the Ads and inserts links to its competitors, makes Google any money?</p>

<p>Can someone make a script that removes all Cory's posts with the word "Cory" in it?  I know Cory is blogs about himself because nobody else will, but that doesn't mean i have to read it.  "DRM" would be a good keyword too.</p>
