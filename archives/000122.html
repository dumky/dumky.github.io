<p>I'm going to be moving really soon, so the blog will be frozen for some time (one month, maybe two). Mostly, I don't think I'll have much time to spend writing new posts, but I'm not sure that the temporary hosting solution that I'll find will allow anything but static files anyway...<br />
The feedback, trackback and search systems will most likely be broken during that time. Sorry for the inconvenience and broken links.<br />
I hope to be completely online as soon as possible early next year.</p>
