<p>To handle all the interesting blogs, I usually do a 2 pass browse: the first allows me to skim lots of posts that I either quickly read or never will read and the second is more thorough and limited to the most interesting posts. These selected ones, I usually bookmark (with the online eBookmarks) for later reading.</p>

<p>But most of the blogs that use a custom blog tool usually make the same mistake: <u>they forget to set the &lt;title> for the page</u>. For example, Movable Type does it fine, but weblogs.asp.net doesn't (I'll mail Scott about that).<br />
This makes it painful to bookmark these pages. I also heard that Google gives some extra value to the title, so you want this metadata to be relevant. Also Google uses the title when displaying search results.<br />
Having both the blog name and the post title is good, but the blog name by itself is pretty useless. </p>

<p>So please, if you code your own blog tool, set the title correctly.</p>
<p><u>Update:</u><br />
