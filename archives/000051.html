<p>I tried the <a href="http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/">Technorati</a> "cosmos" tool a couple times since I started my blog. And today it listed the first inbound link to my blog ! ;-)<br />
Most of my traffic so far was from Google searches on various topics (delegates, windows hooks, graffiti, javascript). I need to analyze my logs and get a better idea of who is visiting me.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks to Stanley from the <a href="http://shell2.shore.net/~syamane/weblog/blogger.html">Programmer's Ink</a> who linked my delegates articles and good luck with your blog too.</p>

<p>Cheers<br />
Dumky</p>
