<p>Via <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/48019">metafilter</a>, check out the <a href="http://connectmedia.waag.org/toool/whatthebump.wmv">demonstration (97 min, Windows Media format)</a> of this incredible lockpicking technique by the <a href="http://www.toool.nl/index-eng.php">TOOOL association</a>. It explains the principle behing the technique and shows how to make your own tools (filing a key into a bumpkey).<br />
 <br />
What's impressive about this technique is that it apparently requires very little training, works with a large majority of pin tumbler locks and doesn't leave any trace. <br />
In addition, the tools (a bumpkey that fits the target lock and a flexible hammer) are simple, discreet and easy to make (bumpkeys seem surprisingly tolerant to fabrication flaws).</p>
<p> <br />
Also worth checking out, a howto video for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/w/How-to-make-lockpicks.?v=-Xn94fq8CUk">making your own (traditional) lockpick set</a>.</p>

<p><u>Update (2006/05/01): </u> MindCamp 2.0 was held this week-end. It was a blast. Amongst other things, someone had brought some looks and some bumpkeys for people to try. It was really trivial. <br />
On my first try I bumped the key maybe half a dozen times before successfully opening the lock. My second try actually took longer, but still didn't take long or require any skills.</p>

That is just simply crazy. Who would be the customers for such tools? Thieves? </p>

<p>well think of the possibilities of this information has if it hits main stream, im sure it beats the old fasioned breaking entering way of prying in with a flathead and takes less time this is truely a problem. The fact it takes almost no effort and is reletivly fast makes it a powerful tool for the common criminal. kinda makes you think twice about leaving home.</p>

<p>It's not neccessarily only criminals that use this technique.  A lot of people practice traditional lockpicking as a recreation, and many people don't do it without permission or on other homeowners' locks.</p>

<p>there's a saying-"only the paranoid survive".  By properly evaluating the flaws in security mechanisms, while providing a forum for disussion on how best to detect said flaws while refining the process on security, are we then able to feel "secure".  </p>
