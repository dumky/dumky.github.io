Last week-end I watched a few episodes of <a href="http://www.hulu.com/lie-to-me">Lie to me</a> on Hulu. It's a detective show with a focus on the science of expressions. It is a good watch so far, with strong acting by Tim Roth and Kelli Williams (Lindsay in "The Practice"). We will have to see how the show maintains interest long-term (the pattern may not bear that much repetition). </p>

<p>As I suspected, the science behind the show is based on Paul Ekman's research on micro-expressions. <br />
It shows that emotions surface in ways that are both unconscious and hard to control, and surprisingly universal across cultures. Ekman uses detailed micro-expression analysis on recorded video to understand the tell-tales of liars and at-risk marriages.<br />
He comments on each episode on this <a href="http://fox.com/blogs/lietome/">"Lie to me" blog</a>.</p>

<p>Another cool thing, Ekman's Facial Action Coding System is also the framework behind <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/ed_ulbrich_shows_how_benjamin_button_got_his_face.html">Benjamin Button's computer generated face</a>. </p>

<p>Hi, It's really nice to read comments about "Lie to me" here on your blog. Basically It really is a nice series. I mean it feels good when you learn some thing new about expressions... each time some one points at expressions in episodes...and you say Ahh!! that's really the way we usually do in our daily life.... :)</p>

<p>It seems that different nationalities have more semblances than I thought before!</p>

<p>I got 16 out of 20 on the "Spot the Fake Smile" test. I think your first gut reaction is best. The ones I thought about too much are the ones I got wrong. In an actual interaction I think our emotion towards the other person might really cloud the issue too. I'm with your husband though and recognize that some people I know don't seem very genuine in there interactions. The eyes definitely give it away.</p>

<p>Cool and nice blog. Great work!</p>

<p>Julien, you have right, the framework behind Benjamin Button's computer generated face is a really fantastic thing.<br />

<p>Thank for the tips. I don´t think I can see this Tv series from Europe. But I find very interesting this topic of micorexpressions and Ekman´s work. Didn´t know anything about it..</p>

<p>I adore Eckman! I was really fascinated by his theory of emblematic slips (especially his test with the nurses).</p>

<p>At work I never really kept an eye on the facial expressions of my colleagues, when working together with them. Thanks for the information.</p>

<p>I often look at the faces of my colleagues. It is quite funny to guess what they may think when the look at someone. </p>
