<h2 class="title">Introduction</h2>

<p>This blog is an experiment. I want to make it a tool to share my experiences and discoveries. Here are some background information about me and some insights on what this blog might contain.</p>

<a name="more"></a>
<p>I'm 26 years old and I work as software engineer. I did most of my studies back in France, were I come from.<br />
Although I was in touch with computers early, they became a passion pretty late. My background is otherwise pretty scientific, and I am still intensly curious about Maths, Physics, Medecine and other scientific fields.<br />
As any human, I also have interest in sociological and psychological matters, but with no or very little formal education.</p>

<p>I plan on using this blog to share some of things I find both in life and in the cyberspace. I love to discover and learn stuff, but teaching and sharing is what I enjoy best right after.<br />
Some of my spare time I use to develop some personal software. It's usually for fun, but most of them have either a concrete use to me or represented something of a challenge. I'll probably write about these projects in these pages.<br />
As any software engineer, I keep wandering and exploring the web. Lots of cool stuff I find through other people's blogs and some I find by myself. In any case, some of these nuggets will make it to these pages too.<br />
Also, I expect to write about some books or movies, or maybe even work (who knows).</p>

<p>Anyway all this is likely to evolve, so stay tuned.<br />
I'll set up a public email address soon, in case you want to contact me.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, some pointers to my other sites:<br />

- <a href="http://cvs.monstuff.com/">CVS repository</a></p>

<p>Cheers,<br />
Dumky</p>

<p>Shrinivas, some details on the Java applet are available at <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/000012.html#comments">http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/000012.html#comments</a><br />
I sent you an email with the same info. Basically, get the applet from Palm and de-compile it.</p>
