<h2 class="title">Blog sticker</h2>

<p>Scoble mentions that <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/07/31.html#a4029">bloggers are all around us and we don't know them</a>.<br />
I know at least 3 on my floor in RedWest-D, but I didn't find out about it immediately. If somebody could design a cool sticker (glueless if possible) for bloggers to show themselves, it would be a bit like warchalking applied to blogs.</p>

<p>The sticker should have some room so that you can write your blog's address. It would also have some variants to denote various types of blogs (technical, political, personal,...).<br />
I can see these stickers selling on thinkgeek.com already ;-)</p>

<a name="more"></a>
<p><u>Update:</u> I wrote a little image generator application to make "antipixel"-style stickers, like Richard suggested. I'll convert it to a web application and host it somewhere. In the meantime, below are some sample images and here is <a href="/archives/images/BlogStickerGenerator.exe">the executable</a>. The application allows you to tweak the generated image if needed, save it as a bitmap. I also just added anti-aliasing of the text so it looks nicer ;-)</p>

<p><img src="/archives/images/blogsticker5.gif"/></p>

<p><img src="/archives/images/blogsticker4.gif"/></p>

<p>The handwritten font I used in the example above is <a href="http://www.webfontlist.com/pages/station.asp?ID=10104&x=Fonts">Augie</a>. Just install it and it will appear in the list the next time you launch the app.</p>

<p>One problem with this design is that it breaks the <a href="http://www.antipixel.com/blog/archives/2002/10/22/steal_these_buttons.html">original antipixel look</a> by having a very wide right-side half, for the url. And from a quick survey, most blog urls are longer than mine, which makes the issue worse.</p>

<p>Not having the url (see example below) wouldn't have this proportion problem, but I think it's much less useful: you want people who walk by your office to give your blog a run without having to ask you the url.</p>

<p><img src="/archives/images/blogsticker3.gif"/></p>

<p>I also found the material that I want: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&q=static cling inkjet white&btnG=Google Search">inkjet printable static cling</a>. I'm ordering some ;-)</p>

<p><u>Update:</u><br />
Got <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/08/03.html#a4131">Scobleized</a> for the first time! <br />
But Robert, "Dumky" takes no 'e' ;-)</p>

<p>Hmm... how about a bumper sticker using the "antipixel" visual style, with "BLOG" on the left and space for a url at the right...</p>

<p>Using the little app, how do you save the picture?</p>

<p>It automatically saves the images to a file ('test.bmp' in the executable's folder) every time you generate a new image.<br />
I'll improve the UI soon though, to allow choosing the file name and image format (gif, bmp,...).</p>

<p>I get a security permission related error. So, I hope you find some time to work your brilliance on converting it to a web application. And, then I hope you've got a good relationship with your hosting company because if word gets out, it'll be very popular.</p>

<p>ZÈQuinTÛ, I wrote a little program that would generate an image with an antipixel look. It's linked in the blog post.<br />
Sorry, I don't know how/where to get actual stickers though.</p>
