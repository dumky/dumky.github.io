<p>Until now, the Xbox 360 software would allow reading pictures and music shared from a PC (running Windows Media Connect), but not video. For video streaming, you had to run Windows Media Center on the PC.<br />
A recent update of the Xbox 360 now allows video streaming from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/devices/wmconnect/">Windows Media Connect</a> or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/11/default.aspx">Windows Media Player 11</a>, although for WMV files only. Luckily, VLC can convert most video formats (DivX, Xvid, etc.) to WMV.</p>

<p>Here are some tips:<br />
First, verify that your 360 can access MP3s and pictures shared via Windows Media Connect. That's pretty easy, as long as your 360 and PC are on the same subnet.<br />
Then, you can get some sample WMV HD files from the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/musicandvideo/hdvideo/contentshowcase.aspx<br />
">WMV HD Content Showcase</a>, share them and stream then. <br />
Finally, use VLC thru this <a href="http://happybeggar.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=60&Itemid=2">convenient one-click conversion batch script</a> to transcode videos to WMV format for streaming playback on the 360.</p>

<p>The re-encoding approach using VLC is not as smooth as an on-the-fly transcoding (which <a href="http://digg.com/gaming_news/Xbox_360_DivX_Playback_Guide">TVersity apparently now supports</a>), since you have to wait until the conversion is complete before you can watch the video. On the other hand, it doesn't require a super powerful PC, provided that you are not in a rush.</p>
<p><b>Update (2007/12/06):</b> A new version of the Xbox 360 dashboard was just released. The update <a href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/xbox-360-divx%5Cxvid-test/xbox-360-divxxvid-tested-it-plays-almost-everything-329769.php">includes support for DivX/Xvid codecs</a>. Yay!<br />
