<p>Here are some recent and cool display technologies:<br />
<ul><li><a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/telegnosis-vga-over-usb-20-015848.php">VGA over USB2</a>. </li> <li><a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~heidrich/Projects/HDRDisplay/">High dynamic range displays</a>. The latest prototype uses ultra-bright LEDs as the backlight for a LCD that acts as a transparency modulator. The resolution of the LEDs is far less than that of the LCD, so some software is needed to compensate with the LCD component. </li> <li><a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/better-picture-of-sonys-black-backed-projection-screen-016964.php">Sony's "black" projection screen</a>. It absorbs light that isn't a pure tone (ambient light), which is why it looks black when no image is projected. But primary colors (red, green and blue rays) are reflected, as shown on this <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/images/sony_blackscreen.jpg">explanatory diagram</a> (via <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/04/06/23/1236235.shtml?tid=137&tid=196">slashdot</a>). </li> <li><a href="http://www.trnmag.com/Stories/2004/063004/Holograms_enable_pocket_projectors_063004.html">Hologram-based projectors</a>, that uses a holographic component that can be driven by a computer. </li><li><a href="http://www.dottocomu.com/b/archives/002571.html">Sony's Librie ebook</a>, that uses <a href="http://www.eink.com/">e-ink</a> for the display. Unfortunately it is rendered almost useless by <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/07/02/sonys_librie_ebook_r.html">dumb DRM</a>. </li><li>MEMS displays, presented in this <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=14037#14037">video tour of MS Research</a>. The idea is to use the regular chip manufacturing process to build chips with moving parts. You can have a chip that holds and orients many miniature mirrors. These cheap components can be combined in an large array and individually illuminated by small lasers to obtain a very large and cost-efficient display. </li><li>Autostereographic displays: either using some <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,4149,425902,00.asp">lenses</a> or <a href="http://sharp-world.com/products/device/about/technology/">parallax barriers</a>. Here's some more details on <a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~pbourke/stereographics/lenticular/">both techniques</a>. </li></lu></p>
<p><u>Update:</u> A high dynamic range display using LEDs behind the LCD was <a href="http://siggraph.blogspot.com/2004/08/incredible-displays.html">demonstrated at SIGRAPH04</a>. </p>
