<p>The <a href="http://mappoint.msn.com/DirectionsFind.aspx">MSN Maps &amp; Directions site</a> features a very cool technology for displaying navigation maps in a more usable way. To try it, choose the "LineDrive" map style.<br />
 <br />
It produces results such as this:<br />

 <br />
Basically, it performs multiple layout optimizations to avoid having very short roads appear very small because of very long roads and a dumb constant scale factor. This re-ordering is performed while keeping some consistency in the layout (maintain the direction of turns , keep the correct intersections, keep the lengths ordered, and other constraints).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/routemaps/">"Rendering Effective Route Maps: Improving Usability Through Generalization"</a> page (with pdf papers) goes in great details of this very interesting algorithm.</p>

<p>I'd also be interested in finding more details on the actual path finding (that takes place before the above mentioned optimizations). It is probably related to a "shortest path" algorithm like <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm">Dijkstra's Algorithm</a>, but there surely are many performance issues that arise when you try to scale up like MapQuest.</p>
