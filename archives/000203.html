<p>In the "I wish I had more time and understood more" departments, here's a great list of pointers to the <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/~tor/sig2004.html">Siggraph 2004 papers</a>. <br />
The two I checked out so far, from <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~carlson/">Mark Carlson</a> and <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/~fedkiw/">Ron Fedkiw</a>, on fluid and solid dynamics are really impressive and realistic. Be sure to check out the videos.</p>
