<p>Here's a random idea I had while reading about <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/5696150847203572/">Tivo giving away its Home Media option for free</a>: what if you could order a pizza from your networked Tivo?</p>

<p>You can run interactive networked program on Tivo, like an <a href="http://grumet.net/weblog/archives/2004/01/29/000598.html">RSS reader</a> or a <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/print_article/0,3998,a=113180,00.asp">Caller ID notifier</a>.<br />
You can also <a href="http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=04/05/09/2341225">order pizza from the command line</a>.<br />
Ordering pizza from your Tivo is just a matter of combining the two with a little Tivo GUI.</p>

<p>Tivo would remember your ordering options, so that subsequent orders are even faster. It could even analyze your order pattern and suggest/remind you to order a pizza before you watch your favorite sports event.</p>
<p><u>Update:</u> The same idea could transpose to the X-Box. </p>

<p>I kind of wonder why the Tivo doesn't seem to support any kind of native plugin support (see <a href="http://myhtpc.net/plugins/">myHTPC plug-ins</a> or Microsoft's <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/developer/default.mspx">Media Center extensions</a>). </p>

<p>The same idea could also extend to other tasks (like buying movie tickets). <br />
But at the same time you don't want to re-create a browser. A possible solution would be for PizzaHut or MovieFone to not only offer html and wml versions of their websites, but also support a "10-foot interface" style. <br />
The question is how to avoid having the user input personal data using a remote... Maybe the Tivo website could be used as a portal, and maybe also a single sign-in provider. Or the "TivoML" framework would allow the page to access the information cached in your Tivo with script, while being careful to keep the user in control of his private data.</p>

<p><u>Update (2005/02/19):</u> still no pizza ordering from your Tivo (alhtough it could be possible to implement using the <a href="http://tivohme.sourceforge.net/">Tivo SDK (HME)</a>)... but it just <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/02/18/everquest_now_with_p.html">came to Everquest</a> (type the "/pizza" command during the game).</p>

<p>The TV broadcasting is not working like the Internet does that is content on demand but rather as a carousel of channels being constantly aired and delivered with a certain delay giving the illusion that that it's on demand! But nice Idea anyway!</p>

<p>I'm not sure what you mean. Are you saying that you don't think ordering pizza from a Tivo or other internet-enabled PVR is possible?</p>
