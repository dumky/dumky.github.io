<p>I installed the <a href="http://toolbar.google.com/">new Googlebar</a> for IE/Windows. The popup blocking feature is nice, but it appears to breaks popup opening bookmarklets.<br />
Mozilla doesn't block bookmarklet popups, probably because they are triggered purposefully by the user. But the Googlebar 2.0 thinks otherwise and associates the bookmarklet being run with the current website, even if the popup window load a page from an un-blocked domain. So it lets these bookmarklets function properly only if the site's popups weren't blocked.</p>
