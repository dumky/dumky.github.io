<p>Javascript is not yet a full Object Oriented language (but future versions probably will come closer), but I was suprised to discover that it already offers some object oriented facilities, that are described in the articles linked below.</p>
<p>Here is the gist of the syntax:<br />
<i><br />
function MyObject() {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; // This is the constructor. It can take parameters if you want<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; this.myAttribute = 0;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; this.setAttribute = setAttributeImpl;<br />
}</p>

<p>function setAttributeImpl(param1) {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; this.myAttribute = param1;<br />
}<br />
</i></p>

<p>What differentiates the <i>MyObject</i> constructor from a regular function is actually up to the caller. <i>MyObject()</i> needs to be called with <b>new</b> for it to make an object.<br />
For example, you would do:<br />
<i><br />
var obj = <b>new</b> MyObject();<br />
obj.setAttribute(5);<br />
</i></p>

<p><br />
A nice <a target="_blank" href="http://www.chunkysoup.net/advanced/oojavascript1/">intro on the subject</a>.<br />
Also, if you want to add attributes and methods to objects that you don't own, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/proto.shtml">prototype attribute</a> is your solution.<br />
Another <a href="http://www-105.ibm.com/developerworks/education.nsf/web-onlinecourse-bytitle/BD68E347CDF483F886256B100075321D?open&l=961,t=gr">detailed article</a> on the subject (free registration required). Update: the link is now available in the <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/views/web/tutorials.jsp">IBM developerWorks  >  Web architecture</a> section, as <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/edu/wa-dw-wajsobj-i.html">Creating and using JavaScript objects</a>.</p>

<p>Personally, I liked to store my object-like structures by creating extra attributes in the DOM (usually with an underscore prefix) and have a naming convention for the methods. The <a href="http://cvs.monstuff.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/CSharpWebControls/Selector/">Selector webcontrol</a> uses this trick, but I am considering switching to using javascript "objects" as it might make debugging easier and design a bit simpler.</p>

<p>What is name of the IBM tutorial?  The link doesn't work, even with the obvious manipulations and there are no pointers that help in searching DeveloperWorks :(</p>
