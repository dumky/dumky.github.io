<p>After two months with my blog in a lethargic/frozen state, I finally set MovableType up again. It feels really good to be able to un-pile items/nuggets/ideas from my mind again :-)</p>

<p>This is my first occasion to wish everyone a happy new year! <br />
But by now I should rather say a happy new <i>Chinese</i> year, since tomorrow is the first day of the <a href="http://www.chinapage.com/newyear.html">year of the Monkey</a> ;-)</p>
<p><b>The setup:</b><br />
The server isn't at home anymore, I'm using a website hosting service (<a href="http://www.purenrg.com/hosting_blog.asp">Pure Energy Systems' Blog Website Hosting</a>). This service seems great so far, as the account was setup quickly and the server has everything needed for MovableType.<br />
I did run into some problems though.</p>

<p><b>Some problems:</b><br />
First, I tried to directly re-use my previous Berkeley DB directory on the new setup, but it wouldn't work. This is probably a problem with the Berkeley DB file version, not MovableType.</p>

<p>Second, when I first imported my exported entries into the new site, the post IDs where completely messed up, which means the permalinks don't match the original ones.<br />
This is a known problem, encountered by <a href="http://mar.anomy.net/entry/2003/06/22/17.15.00/">Már Örlygsson (Howto: Future-proof URLs in Movable Type)</a> and <a href="http://www.cookcomputing.com/blog/archives/000254.html">Charles Cook (Importing/Exporting Movable Type)</a>.<br />
I opted for Charles' solution, which is to tweak the backup file by introducing bogus entries/drafts.<br />
If you plan on moving your MT blog, you should at least do Charles' export script modification ahead of time (adds a blogid line to every post), to keep your options open.<br />
Also, I thought of using the TypePad service from the MovableType team, but their url format has changed to something like <i>/2004/01/progress_prompt.html</i>, which would break my permalinks as well...</p>

<p><u>Update:</u> The Learning Movable Type blog has a nice post on <a href="http://www.elise.com/mt/archives/000255moving_your_mt_blogs_to_a_new_server_or_web_host.php">Moving your MT Blogs to a New Server or Web Host</a>.</p>
