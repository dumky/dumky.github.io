<p>This script lets you scroll down the search results without having to turn pages, in using infinite scrolling.</p>

This is a variation on the <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/000336.html">"Flickr - Single Page Results"</a> I wrote yesterday.</p>

<p>Hey Ryan,</p>

<p>Thanks for the pointer. I did not find that script when I was searching on userscripts.<br />
What are the nicer features from the "Google Auto Pager" script? <br />
One feature which my script has is it leaves some landmarks (an horizontal divider and a page number) to help locate yourself.</p>

<p>Your script seems to have a bug - when there are less than 10 results, the results are  duplicated again and again.</p>
