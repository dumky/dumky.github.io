<p>I am amazed by all the early activity going on around Longhorn in the blogs I read, all the while Whidbey's release is still at least a year from now... <br />
Anyways, waiting until Longhorn to benefit from declarative UI development seems like a long time. <a href="http://www.xamlon.com/">XAMLON</a> is a library that attempts to bridge the gap by bringing a subset of XAML into the 1.1 .NET world.<br />
Its approach is a bit different from Avalon's, as the XAML isn't compiled, but instead interpreted at runtime, and as a consequence the markup can't contain logic code. My guess is that's because the 1.1 framework doesn't support partial classes.</p>
<p>There are some other attempts at describing .NET UI with XML, like <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/eporter/archive/2003/06/06/8364.aspx">UISerializer</a> and <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/UserSamples/Details.aspx?SampleGuid=c4548d30-c11e-4465-bb7d-7191cfd50dd2">XML Forms</a>.</p>

<p>In the non-.NET world, there is <a href="http://glade.gnome.org">Glade XML</a> (for GTK), XUL (used in Mozilla and some Java projects like <a href="http://www.thinlet.com/">Thinlets</a> or <a href="http://luxor-xul.sourceforge.net/">Luxor XUL</a>) and Swing XML (<a href="http://www.swixml.org/">SwiXml</a>).</p>
