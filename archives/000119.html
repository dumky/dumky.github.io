<p>I had heard from this initiative internally a while back, but it is now official: <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/saraw/permalink.aspx/d9c95ff4-9785-4714-9c2d-a76fc8cb8172">users can comment/annotate some MSDN reference pages</a>. More info can be found on the <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/annotations/annotations.aspx">MSDN Lab Annotations page</a>.<br />
The <a href="http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com">Longhorn SDK pages</a> on MSDN already have the feature deployed.</p>

<p>It looks very similar to the <a href="http://us4.php.net/manual/en/">annotation feature in the PHP documentation</a> which is most useful. But there are some differences:<br />
- the MSDN annotations appear to only be available in IE,<br />
- they are exposed via RSS feeds, which I don't think is the case for PHP notes,<br />
- there is no mention of any moderation, while the PHP notes are moderated.</p>

<p>Anyway, I couldn't find any annotations on the API pages yet, so I guess we'll have to wait to see if this feature really enriches MSDN, as it did PHP.</p>
<p><u>Update:</u> O'Reilly has published annotations for the Longhorn SDK and <a href="http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2003/11/19/longhorn.html">describes the annotation system</a>. Annotations can be provided by third-parties, through an specially-formatted RSS feed (fetched, cached and displayed by the SDK annotation component that you install on the client).</p>

<p><u>Update:</u> Thinking more about it, RSS seems like a bad solution to the annotation problem. What you want is some kind of annotation database that can be queried for information related to a specific page or topic, not a stream of annotations. You still want to access old annotations, but they'll get pushed out of the RSS feed as new annotations are added...<br />
On the other hand I agree RSS fits in the scenario where you want to monitor any new notes posted relative to a topic, but I would guess that's not the most common need.</p>
