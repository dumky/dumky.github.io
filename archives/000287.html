<p>The <a href="http://www.squarefree.com/shell/">Javascript Shell</a> is an awesome utility for javascript development. It was written by Jesse Ruderman and some other contributors. <br />
The bookmarklet version is the most useful, but it unfortunately only works in Firefox.</p>

<p>Here is an updated version which brings some love to IE developers: <a href="javascript:function loadScript(scriptURL) { var scriptElem = document.createElement('SCRIPT'); scriptElem.setAttribute('language', 'JavaScript'); scriptElem.setAttribute('src', scriptURL); document.body.appendChild(scriptElem);} loadScript('http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/images/jsshell.js');" onclick="{alert('Don\'t click on this link, bookmark it instead');return false;}">Javascript Shell for IE</a> bookmarklet.<br />
You might run into issues with pop-up blockers, in which case you can simply allow pop-ups from the site you're working with.</p>
<p> <br />
<h4>Remote loading:</h4> The first problem with supporting IE is IE's limitation in bookmarklet size. Since version 5.5, IE only allows 512 characters in bookmarklets. <br />
The simple workaround is to use a small bookmarklet which acts as a bootstrap but doesn't contain the actual code. Instead it inserts a &lt;script> element to load the large script content remotely.<br />
Brad Neuberg has an <a href="http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2005/08/ajax-creating-huge-bookmarklets.html">implementation of this remote loading bookmarklet</a>, which I re-used.<br />
The <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/images/jsshell.js">script file that is remotely loaded</a> is currently hosted on my blog, but I'd love to host it somewhere else. Hopefully, the caching headers should avoid a large part of the server traffic and load. Let me know if you have some alternative hosting suggestions.<br />
 <br />
<h4>Finding the caret position:</h4> The second problem was in the Javascript Shell code itself, with a function that figures out the position of the caret inside a textarea. That code didn't work in IE, as IE and Firefox use pretty different methods for dealing with selections.</p>

<p>Here is the fixed <i>getcaretpos</i> method, which uses a <a href="http://www.bazon.net/mishoo/articles.epl?art_id=1292">technique described by Mihai Bazon</a>:<br />
<div class="code">function getcaretpos(inp)<br />
{    <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; if(inp.selectionEnd != null)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return inp.selectionEnd;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; // IE specific code<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; var range = document.selection.createRange();<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; var isCollapsed = range.compareEndPoints("StartToEnd", range) == 0;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; if (!isCollapsed)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; range.collapse(false);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; var b = range.getBookmark();<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; return b.charCodeAt(2) - 2;<br />
}</div><br />
 <br />
<h4>Enumerating members of a javascript object:</h4> There is one more problem, with tab completion, which I couldn't fix yet. <br />
If you type "document.getE" and then press TAB, a couple of completions should be suggested to you, including "getElementsByName". <br />
This works in Firefox, but in IE it doesn't.</p>

<p>If you evaluate "document.getElementsByName" in IE, you get:<br />
"function getElementsByName() { [native code] }".<br />
So it looks like native methods don't get listed when enumerating the members of an object. A more direct repro is to call "props(document)" or evaluate "for(var i in document) { print(i); }". <br />
Within the Javascript Shell on Firefox this will list "getElementsByName" as one of the possibilities, but it's missing in the case of IE.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on how to work around this?</p>

<p><u>Update (2006/04/26):</u> I posted a <a href="http://media.putfile.com/Demo-of-the-Javascript-Shell-bookmarklet-in-IE">screencast of the Javascript Shell bookmarklet for IE</a> on PutFile (best viewed in "800" size).</p>

<p><u>Update (2006/05/01):</u> <a href="http://www.netcrucible.com/blog/">Joshua Allen</a>, who is now a technical evangelist on the IE7 team, pointed out that this bookmarklet doesn't work in the latest version of IE7. <br />
IE7 Beta 2 (5346.5) crashes when you try to launch the javascript shell from the bookmarklet. I'll follow up with him to investigate.</p>

<p><u>Update (2006/06/07):</u> I haven't identified the crashing issue yet, it didn't crash for me on all the versions of IE7 that I tried.<br />
I did a fix for IE7 though: you can now complete with Ctrl-Space, in addition to Tab. Tab doesn't work well, because it actually moves the focus to the new url bar in pop-up windows... Use Ctrl-Space instead.</p>

<p>Nice job - this is badly needed in IE.</p>

<p>This script causes IE7 to crash?</p>

<p>This is badly needed for IE, it has been a great<br />
tool in Firefox and I hope to use it in IE.</p>
