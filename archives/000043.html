<p>Here is an old but interesting article about <a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/Issues/Comsci01/Compsci2001-11.html">numeric bases and their efficiency</a>.</p>

<p>Different bases have different "efficiencies". <br />
Base 10000, for example, has a really huge alphabet (0 thru 9999) but may express large numbers with very few digits (9999 is just one digit, in comparison to 4 in base 10). <br />
Base 2, on the other hand, has a small alphabet (only 2 symbols) but requires more digits to express large numbers (14 digits are required to write the number 9999).</p>

<p>The problem is then to optimize both the number of symbols in the alphabet and the number of digits needed to express a given large number, by minimizing the product of these two indicators for example. This approach brings out the ternary base as being the most efficient.</p>
<p><b>Finding the minima</b><br />
Although the calculus is pretty simple, it's been a couple years since I hadn't done such a function analysis, so I wanted to verify I could still do it.</p>

<p>Here is how you get to the result described in the article:<br />
Let's call <b>b</b> the base (>1) and <b>n</b> the number of digits needed to express some large number <b>N</b> in that base. We want to minimize <b>bxn</b>.<br />
Because <b>N=b^n</b>, you can write <b>n=log(N)/log(b)</b>. <br />
So we are now trying to minimize <b>b/log(b)</b>, which is defined for b in ]0,1[ and ]1,&infin;[, and can be derived on those interval.<br />
The derived function is <b>1/log(b) - 1/log(b)^2</b>.<br />
Given that log(b)<1 for b in ]1,e[ and log(b)>1 for b in ]e,&infin;[, we find the minima we were looking for: b=e.</p>
