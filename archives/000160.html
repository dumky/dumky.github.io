<p>Miguel announced that Novell just <a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/archive/2004/Mar-22.html">released the source for iFolder</a> and its underlying metadata store (Simias). That shows the power of mono to enable cross platform scenarios based on .Net.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/project/?ifolder">Novell Forge project page for iFolder</a>. I look forward to reading their source :-)</p>

<p>One thing that seems a tad limited is the P2P aspect, since it apparently requires that you be on the same network. C# implementation of JXTA anyone?</p>
<p><u>Update:</u> <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/03/23/037250">Slashdot's report</a>.</p>
