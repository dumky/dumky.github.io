<p>Here's a Greasemonkey user script to <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/images/XMLHttpRequestTracing.user.js" title="right click &#8594; Install User Script...">trace XMLHttpRequest calls</a> in the javascript console. It logs the "open" and "send" calls, as well as the response status code and text.<br />
Its purpose is to help peek into AJAX applications, to learning or troubleshooting, without having to run a network sniffer.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/images/XMLHttpRequestTracing-Screenshot.jpg">screenshot </a>shows a sample output (Google Suggest). Each XMLHttpRequest instance is assigned a random ID (781 in this example) that allows you to track multiple requests being run in parallel.</p>

<p>It's a pretty early version, so feel free to send some suggestions and feedback.<br />
It doesn't work on GMail. I'm not sure why yet (any pointers appreciated ;-).</p>

<p>Thanks to the anonymous contributor that posted that idea in the <a href="http://dunck.us/collab/GreaseMonkeyUserScriptRequest">Greasemonkey user script requests</a> page.</p>
<p><u>Update (2005/06/02):</u> I just posted a new and re-vamped script for <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/000252.html">XMLHttpRequest debugging</a>. It implements some debugging features beyond simply tracing, such as editing and replaying requests.</p>

<p><u>Update (2005/07/10):</u> Due to security reasons, the GM_* functions were removed from Greasemonkey 0.3.5 until a more secure design is found. The XMLHttpRequest Tracing script requires the GM_log function and therefore won't work at all on these "neutered" versions of Greasemonkey.</p>

<p><u>Update (2006/01/12):</u> Fixed script to work in Firefox 1.5 with Greasemonkey 0.6.4. It's probably broken for older version thought.</p>

<p>I tried it for www.backpackit.com, and it made it so that Backpack would no longer accept my updates.<br />

<p>Sage, I just tried it on backpackit.com and I didn't have any problem (updates are working).<br />
What specific operation is not working?<br />
Thanks,</p>

<p>I tried adding an item to a list and the little spiraling "pending" circle icon just kept spinning.  Same thing when I tried to add a note.  </p>

<p>I thought maybe it was making a server call to this site and that was slowing it down, but I let it run for a couple of minutes and nothing happened.</p>

<p>I also noticed that when I tried to delete items, they disappear as if it worked correctly, but when I refresh or login with a different browser the items are actually still there.<br />

<p>This is a nice exercise, but why not just use Live HTTP Headers?</p>

<p>Adrian, Live HTTP Headers is most useful. But it only shows the headers, whereas this user script also shows the body of the response, which is quite useful in AJAX applications.</p>

<p>I'm thinking of adding some XMLHttpRequest debugging features that go beyond simply tracing (if an implementation is possible):<br />
- log XHR interactions in a separate window/pane/div rather than the javascript console. <br />
- in that interface, let users replay callbacks (maybe allowing to modify the response body).<br />
- let users intercept (breakpoint) and modify requests and responses as they go .<br />

<p>Sage, I'm still trying to repro this problem.<br />
What OS and browser versions are you running?<br />
Do you have any messages in the javascript console that might be related?<br />
Thanks,</p>

<p>What is the url that is needed to be added to the greasemonkey script?</p>

<p>I am just starting out with greasemonkey and I tried with the following link <br />
<a href="http://www.google.com/*">http://www.google.com/*</a></p>

<p>but the JS console shows no output</p>

<p>I am using Greasemonkey 0.2.6 on Firefox 1.0.3.  My OS is Windows XP.  The javascript console didn't actually open.</p>

<p>Hey Sage. Same platform as me.<br />
Do you mean the javascript console won't open at all? Did you try to open it via the "Tools" menu or some other way?<br />
</p>

<p>Makash, the main Google search page doesn't use XMLHttpRequest. Try Google Suggest instead, at <a href="http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1">http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1</a><br />

<p>Sorry, a little confusion on my end.  Anyway, I opened the JavaScript console, and when I use Backpackit it doesn't log anything when I try to add or delete items.  <br />
So, I added Feedmarker.com and sproutliner.com to the Greasemonkey script to try those sites.  I get the following errors.  In Sproutliner:<br />
Error: GM_log is not defined<br />
Source File: <a href="http://sproutliner.com/">http://sproutliner.com/</a><br />
Line: 149</p>

<p>And in Feedmarker.com:<br />
Client_Error:ReferenceError:GM_log is not defined.</p>

<p>Sage, thanks for taking the time to troubleshoot this with me. I think that pinpoints the problem: you need Greasemonkey 0.3 and up. The GM_log function didn't exist before that.<br />
I'll update the XMLHttpRequestTracing script to issue a warning when it detects an older version of Greasemonkey.<br />
Sorry about that.</p>

<p>Have you tried Fiddler www.fiddlertool.com</p>

<p>Re: Fiddler<br />
I have used Fiddler tool and a number of other HTTP sniffers.</p>

<p>But they are not geared towards AJAX debugging. In particular, they know nothing about javascript. </p>

<p>The next version of the user script (coming soon) goes beyond simply sniffing, with some features that I think are useful for AJAX debugging. <br />
Feature suggestions are welcome too :-)</p>

<p>I'm also thinking about integrating it with the javascript shell or the javascript development environment (see <a href="http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/webdevel.html">http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/webdevel.html</a> ).</p>

<p>Hi, can you explain how to install this?  I'd love to try it but I'm new to Greasemonkey.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Me again - Okay, I realized the installation instructions were in the script :-).  So it's installed.  Next question: how do you use it?!  When I bring up my javascript console I don't see anything happening... do I have to somehow call the script in my javascript?</p>

<p>Thanks again!</p>

<p>Beth, you need to configure the list of trigger urls for the script so that the script gets run on the pages you want to analyze. <br />
Then you navigate to one of these pages and at that point you should see tracing information appear in the console.</p>

<p>Hi All,<br />
Actually i have a question related to AJAX technology that I want to ask with all of you.</p>

<p>My question is: Can we update database values using Ajax? I have search over the internet but I haven't got any solution regarding upadting database values using Ajax.</p>

<p>I am ASP.NET Developer and looking forward for your suggestion regarding my question.</p>

<p>Thanks in Advance.</p>

<p>Anand, nothing prevents you from updating a database using AJAX. <br />
With ASP.Net, you could use an AJAX framework such as Microsoft Atlas or AJAX.Net as the glue between your client-side javascript and your server-side C#. <br />
But you still need to write C# code that does the database update, given some parameters passed from the client.</p>

<p>I just updated the script to run in Firefox 1.5 and Greasemonkey 0.6.4. Older versions are not supported anymore.</p>
