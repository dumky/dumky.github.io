<p>Here is an awesome optical illusion, that involves <a href="http://www.digitalxpression.co.uk/dwheel.swf">watching a rotating spiral then looking at ones hand</a> (via Hotlinks, flash).<br />
This led me to <a href="http://www.michaelbach.de/ot/">Michael Bach's site</a> which has tons of motion-related illusions, including my <a href="http://www.michaelbach.de/ot/mot_enigma/index.html">grandpa's "Enigma"</a>.<br />
Akiyoshi Kitaoka authored other very effective <a href="http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/saishin2e.html">motion-related illusions</a> (via <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/07/12/dancing_almond_optic.html">Boing Boing</a>).</p>

<p>Here's another one, related to the language centers and the visions centers interfering: <a href="http://www.optillusions.com/dp/1-41.htm">read out the color of the words</a>.<br />
Fabrice also seems to be an amateur of these and <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/fmarguerie/archive/2003/09/14/27482.aspx">links to a couple</a>.</p>
