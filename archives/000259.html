<p>I heard of <a href="http://www.realsimple.com/">RealSimple</a> via <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/05/real_simple_19m.html">43 Folders</a> a while back. I was just able to finally unstack it and actually check the site out. <br />
Access to the articles is actually restricted to the subscribers of the magazine. <br />
But it turns out the design of the security check is quite broken: the printer-friendly pages actually don't perform the check and you can get the url for the printer-friendly pages without being a subscriber. My <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/images/RealSimple-PrinterFriendlyRedirect.user.js" title="right click &#8594; Install User Script...">RealSimple - Printer Friendly Redirect</a> takes you to the more convenient single-page view of the articles, without even having you log in.</p>

<p>Just because their security is not up to par, doesn't make it any more right.</p>

<p>Worked like a charm.  I wonder how long til someone fixes it.  Or maybe the idea was that people who are smart enough to figure out how to bypass the restriction are supposed to get it for free.  </p>

<p>Phizm, the script is actually still working for me.<br />
Try <a href="http://www.realsimple.com/realsimple/content/exclusive/0,21770,1092660,00.html">http://www.realsimple.com/realsimple/content/exclusive/0,21770,1092660,00.html</a> for example. Without the script, I get the login prompt, but with the script, I get the printer-friendly version.</p>
