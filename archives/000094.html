<p>After going through my access and activity logs and noticed some people search for a cvs access to my repository. It definitely is more convenient than cvsweb when downloading a whole project.</p>

<p>The commands that should provide you access:<br />
<i>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.monstuff.com:/home/cvs/ login</i> (and enter a blank password)<br />
<i>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.monstuff.com:/home/cvs/ checkout &lt;project></i></p>

<p>You can find the list of projects <a href="http://cvs.monstuff.com">here</a>.<br />
Let me know if you have any trouble accessing it, by leaving a comment below.</p>
<p>I must say setting up pserver was a bit of a pain. The "passwd" configuration was easy, but then I ran into a problem with some environment variables, which was hard to debug because the service runs in its own context.<br />
Also, I didn't figure out how to restrict the anonymous user's access right away. It turns out the "readers" file in the CVSROOT directory allows that.<br />
Also, since the anonymous user isn't a system user, the "passwd" file in CVSROOT is used to have the process impersonate a real system user.</p>

<p><b>Source Control</b><br />
While on this topic, here are a couple interesting links about source control.<br />
An <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/Beyond_CheckOut_and_CheckIn.html">explanation</a> of the features a repository may support, in this case based on SourceGear's Vault.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/files/documents/15/18/svn-design.pdf">SubVersion design document</a>, that explains the data model for the repository and provides a great overview of SubVersion's architecture.</p>

<p>A rather mysterious repository <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/archrevctl/?topic_id=45%2C52">arch / larch</a> that appears to be quite feature-rich, but I didn't get the time to play with yet. It used to be implemented with shell script, but a C version was more recently developed.</p>

<p>Hello!</p>

<p>I'd love to check out your code via cvs... however I appear to be receiving:</p>

<p>cvs [login aborted]: connect to cvs.monstuff.com(216.231.44.190):2401 failed: Connection refused</p>

<p>I guess you have closed access?</p>

<p>P.S. I agree, pserver is a pain.</p>

<p>Just fixed it, after a forced reboot last week (power loss) I didn't restart xinetd manually and it was not set up to restart automatically.</p>

<p>I just verified that the checkout works, but there is a problem with updating:<br />
cvs login: authorization failed: server cvs.monstuff.com rejected access to /home/cvs for user anonymous</p>

<p>This seems to be related to having a / (slash) after /home/cvs or not.</p>

<p>Always specifying "-d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.monstuff.com:/home/cvs/" is the temporary workaround.</p>
