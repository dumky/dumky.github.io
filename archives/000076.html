<p>Here are a couple of available ones:<br />
A <a href="http://www.kensington.com/html/3720.html">wireless hotspot finder</a>, by Kensington.<br />
For Seattlelites, a <a href="http://www.trafficgauge.com/">pocket traffic monitor</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a gadget that doesn't exist yet but I wish would: a pocket laser projection display. This is something I am sure we'll see more of in the years to come, because cellphone displays are really too small.<br />
Stefan Marti, from MIT Media Lab, got a working prototype of a one line character display, called <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~stefanm/TinyProjector/index.html">TinyProjector</a>.<br />
<a href="http://www.symbol.com/products/oem/lpd.html">Symbol</a> appears to be working on a full VGA display, that is not yet available.</p>
<p><u>Update:</u> The NYT has an article on <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/11/04/pocket_projectors.html">laser-powered pocket projectors</a>.</p>
