<p>I read a mention a couple of days ago (via <a href="http://www.sidhe.org/~dan/blog/archives/000222.html">Dan's post</a>) of Mac users cleaning up their Acrobat Reader's plugin directory to speed up its startup. So it tried the same thing on the Windows version, for use on my desktop and Tablet PC boxes.</p>

<p>The plugin files are located in the "\Program Files\Adobe\Acrobat 6.0\Reader\plug_ins" directory. At startup, Reader loads all of the plugin files it finds under this directory. So to remove a plugin, you need to either delete the file or move it into an "upstream" directory (as backup).<br />
Plugins have dependencies, so removing some random files will bring you a bunch of warnings when you launch Reader. But if you open the "Help" > "About Adobe Plug-Ins" information pane in Reader, you can see what these dependencies are.</p>

<p>For a regular use of Acrobat Reader, with no forms, annotations, emails, multimedia animations, digital signatures, I got a 1/3 improvement in the memory footprint at startup (from 30 Megs down to about 20 Megs).<br />
Here is the list of plugins that I removed:</p>
<p>Annotations<br />
ImageViewer<br />
Multimedia<br />
PictureTasks<br />
PrintMe (directory and .api file)<br />
VDKHome (unsure what this is for)<br />
Accessibility<br />
AcroForm<br />
DigSig<br />
eBook<br />
HLS<br />
MakeAccessible<br />
PDDom<br />
PPKLite<br />
reflow<br />
SaveAsRTF<br />
SendMail<br />
XFA</p>

<p><br />
<u>Update:</u><br />
The Inquirer runs a <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=11041">similar story</a>. Their DIY steps are better than mine though ;-)</p>

<p><u>Update:</u><br />
Apparently, <a href="http://keithdevens.com/weblog/archive/2004/Apr/19/eBooks.Acroread">removing the ebook plugin</a> also stops Acrobat from creating the "My eBooks" folder.</p>

<p><u>Update:</u><br />
A <a href="http://forevergeek.com/articles/load_acrobat_reader_faster.php"">commenter on ForeverGeek</a> pointed out a helper tool (<a href="http://www.tnk-bootblock.co.uk/prods/misc/index.php">Adobe Reader SpeedUp</a>) to do this. </p>

<p><u>Update:</u> Some versions of <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=74534">Acrobat 6 cause freezes in Firefox</a>, updating to 6.0.2 should help.</p>

<p>thnx for the link for SpeedUp.exe. When using it I don't have to wait one or two minutes no more to load a pdf file. It just takes a few seconds instead. This is really a great utility that everyone should use.</p>
