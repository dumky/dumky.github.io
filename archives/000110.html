<p>I recently posted about some things site owners should keep in mind to make their site more user-friendly and also google-friendly. But as a web user, it is also important to learn to make best use of google, by using some of its advanced features.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nedbatchelder.com/blog/200310.html#e20031020T200207">Ned Batchelder</a> mentioned the new <a href="http://www.google.com/help/features.html#definitions">"definitions" feature</a>.<br />
Other great features are listed on Google's <a href="http://www.google.com/help/index.html">Web Search Features</a> page. <br />
Google's <a href="http://www.google.com/help/refinesearch.html">Advanced Search</a> page also lists some tricks like the synonyms search (using '~').</p>

<p><u>Update:</u> Cory points out another <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/07/05/advanced_google_synt.html">Google keyword "allinurl:"</a>.<br />
</p>
