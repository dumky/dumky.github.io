<p><a href="http://electricsheep.org/">Electric Sheep</a> is a poetic screen saver that uses the distributed computation to visualize the "collective dream of sleeping computers" (ie. cool looking fractal animations).<br />
You can get some sample movies from the website, as well as a documentary with artistic and technical explanation.<br />
<a href="http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2003/12/22/sheep.html">Scott Draves's article</a> gives an interesting overview of how the sheeps are born, bred and evolved.</p>
<p>Another interesting kind of mutations: <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/07/18/1826247">animating walking characters via evolution</a>.</p>

<p><u>Update:</u> A DVD was made from Electric Sheep animations. You can get it online from <a href="http://www.spotworks.com/?menu=about">Spotworks</a>.</p>
