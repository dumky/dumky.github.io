<p><a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/greasemonkeyhks/">"Greasemonkey Hacks"</a> was published early November in the O'Reilly hacks series. If you're into Greasemonkey or want to learn more about it, this book has many excellent hacks explained and provides a nice complement to Mark's online book on the topic, <a href="http://diveintogreasemonkey.org/">"Dive Into Greasemonkey"</a>.</p>

<p>I'm happy and proud to have contributed 7 hacks to the book, including "Trace XMLHttpRequest Activity", which is <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/greasemonkeyhks/chapter/hack46.pdf">available online for free (pdf)</a>. <br />
Thanks again, Mark, for the opportunity and feedback. It was a great learning experience and lots of fun!</p>
