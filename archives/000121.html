<p>Soon after the first Matrix episode came out I stumbled on this analysis of the similarities <a href="http://www.geocities.com/tacobelll/matrixgits/page1.html">between the Matrix and Ghost in the Shell</a>.<br />
A friend pointed out another striking comparison, this time between  <a href="http://galeon.hispavista.com/cinerama/actu2/matrixdarkcity.htm">the Matrix and Dark City</a>. It's in spanish, but the images make the point.</p>
