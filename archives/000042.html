<p>As I mentioned in <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/000025.html">this previous blog entry</a>, the next version of C# will probably have the following new features: Generics, Iterators, Anonymous methods and Partial types.<br />
Well, according to <a href="http://java.sun.com/features/2003/05/bloch_qa.html">one of the core Java architects</a> some of these will probably be included in J2SE 1.5.<br />
Not only are Generics and Iterators mentioned, but some of the current C#-specific features are listed as well, like automatic boxing/unboxing and foreach-type loops.<br />
From what I understand of C#, the remaining key features that would differentiate C# from Java after this would be delegates, support for un-managed ("unsafe") code,<i>ref</i> and <i>out</i> keywords, and structs.<br />
The article also mentions "metadata" which seems somewhat like attributes, except that they can be used to generate boilerplate code at compilation-time. But what isn't clear is whether these attributes are customizable and how. A little info can be found on "metadata" on this <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=175">Java Community Process (JCP) page</a>.</p>
<p>More <a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/releases/generics/">details on Generics in Java</a>.</p>

<p><u>Update:</u> The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/team/language">C# 2.0 specs</a> have been published. The original is a Word document, so you can get a converted <a href="/archives/images/C%23-Ver2-Specification.pdf">C# 2.0 specs (PDF)</a> conversion.</p>
