<h2 class="title">AJAX Debugging with Greasemonkey</h2>

<p>Following up on my last Greasemonkey user script, <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/000250.html">"XMLHttpRequest Tracing"</a>, I wrote a new script that goes beyond tracing: <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/images/XMLHttpRequestDebugging.v1.0.user.js" title="right click &#8594; Install User Script...">"XMLHttpRequest Debugging"</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/images/XMLHttpRequestDebugging.v1.0.jpg">screenshot</a> of the new UI. <br />
What it shows is the XMLHttpRequest debugging console, a floating div embedded in the page being debugged. This replaces the javascript console, which the previous script used for tracing.<br />
Each individual XMLHttpRequest invocation will get listed there, with all the details on the request and the response, as well as options to edit and replay the request or replay the response callback.</p>

<p><u>Update:</u> A <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/000268.html">newer version of the script</a> is available.</p>

<a name="more"></a>
<p> <br />
The user script adds a menu command under "Tools" -> "User Script Commands" -> "Show XMLHttpRequest console". It is mostly useful if you click "hide" in the console menu.</p>

<p>The interface makes use of some cool scripts I've seen around, such as the <a href="http://www.axentric.com/posts/default/7">fade anything technique</a> (a variant of 37signal's yellow fade technique) and Aaron Boodman's <a href="http://youngpup.net/2001/domdrag">DOM-Drag</a>. I hope I didn't go overboard ;-)</p>

<p>Here are some possible future features I have been thinking about:<br />
<ul><li>integrate with the Javascript Shell or the Javascript Development Environment, for richer debugging, </li><li>allow breakpointing on the response callback, to let the user modify the server response before the callback occurs, </li><li>use a popup window for the console, rather than a floating div, </li><li>ensure the console remains within the borders of the viewport </li><li>allow creating new XHR requests via a form, similar to the current edit&replay of requests. </ul></p>

<p>I've tested it on a couple of AJAX-based sites. Except for Gmail, most seem to be working fine.</p>

<p>As with <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/cat_greasemonkey.html">my other Greasemonkey scripts</a>, feedback, suggestions and patches are welcome :-)</p>

<p><u>Update (2005/05/12):</u> I just <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/000291.html">ported this script to IE</a>, using a bookmarklet.</p>

<p>A couple things - I hid the form on a page, and now I can't get it back. Second, on a page I've been developing, links update the debugger but don't call my own functions any more. Have you seen anything like this?</p>

<p>David, LiveHTTPHeaders is awesome and was discussed more in comments of the previous post. <br />
The "XMLHttpRequest Debugging" user script tries to go beyond just tracing the headers: it traces the whole response body and it has debug capabilities (you to edit&replay requests with their javascript callback).</p>

<p>Christopher, <br />
There is a menu to get the console back: "Tools" -> "User Script Commands" -> "Show XMLHttpRequest console".<br />
I haven't run into the problem that you are describing. Can you check messages in your javascript console? Also, can you give me some more details on how your page uses XHR?<br />
I'll follow up with you by email.</p>

<p>Great stuff.</p>

<p>I was wondering if you could add a z-index to the XHRDebug_Console to bring it above everything. It just fell behind some of the headers on some pages and then couldn't be dragged away.<br />

<p>Hi Julien,</p>

<p>  Thanks for the tool.</p>

<p>  Does this work with IE ? </p>

<p>  We have a IE only AJAX app and we use proxyTrace for debugging the application. Some times, inserting proxyTrace (<a href="http://www.pocketsoap.com/tcptrace/pt.aspx)">http://www.pocketsoap.com/tcptrace/pt.aspx)</a> creates errors while talking to Tomcat. Hopefully, your tool does NOT have such issues.</p>

</div>
<div class="comments-body">
<p>Anjan, <br />
This tool unfortunately doesn't work in IE, because Greasemonkey is Firefox-only. </p>

<p>Some extensions similar to Greasemonkey are currently being developped for IE (TrixIE, Turnabout). But even then, I'm not sure the same technique can be used to intercept XHR calls in IE. The XHR invocation in IE is different: it uses an ActiveX object, instead of a native javascript object. <br />
In order to intercept XHR calls in IE, you would have to modify your page to use an XHR wrapper, with some hooks for debugging, rather than the ActiveX object directly.</p>

<p>This script is a patch until full-fledged and integrated solutions appear, as this web app development approach becomes more popular.<br />
I'm hoping that long term, mainstream IDEs and debuggers start supporting debugging javascript in the client and server code at the same time. That would be pretty cool ;-)</p>

<p>This is nifty but I think a local HTTP proxy is better served to fit this need.  There are HTTP proxies designed for the purpose of debugging HTTP invocations.</p>

<p>Patrick, did you configure some websites to activate this user script? <br />
When the script is installed, you need to pick a list of "include" url patterns, such as "<a href="http://*.backpackit.com/*">http://*.backpackit.com/*".</a> You need to input the url of the site you want to debug in that configuration panel.<br />
I'll check with you by email.</p>

<p>excellent!  had a hard time getting it working though -- the menu option remained grayed out.  had to remove line 7 (which was just a comment and line break) which was producing a javascript error.  Took out a few similar lines, too, so they may have also been error-producing.)  now it works!</p>

<p>I'm interested in this primarily as a tool for writing a google maps GM script, though, and unfortunately the console doesn't display properly on that site.  I'll look into what the problem could be when I have a chance, but perhaps you could take a quick peak and see if it's an obvious fix.  I couldn't figure out from the UI how to move it, either, but perhaps that's because its top is obscured.</p>

<div class="comments-body">
<p>Ramm, per our discussion by email, the problem is that you are using Greasemonkey 0.3.5.<br />
That release is a security hotfix, which disabled all the GM_* functions such as GM_log or GM_getValue. That's why you're getting some GM_getValue errors in the Javascript console.</p>

<p>I would recommend that you wait for the next version of Greasemonkey, which should support these functions again, while being safe. Keep an eye on <a href="http://greaseblog.blogspot.com/">http://greaseblog.blogspot.com/</a></p>

<p>is it just me or does this script *NOT* work with FF 1.5b2?</p>

<p>Maybe I'm just a dummy but my DIV appears but no debug data gets populated?</p>

<p>Installed the script but it doesn't seem to work. With Google suggest the tracing window appears but I can't move it around and nothing appears in the window.  The User Script Commands menu item of Greasemonkey is always greyed out so if I hide the window the only way to get it back is to reload a configured page (eg Google Suggest).  FWIW I get a ton of JavaScript errors from Google Suggest.</p>

<p>I have firefox 1.5. Alot of things dont seem to work correctly. I cant drag and drop the box, when I minimize the whole thing disappears and user script command option under tools menu is never available, when I hide it there is no way to bring it back. How can firefox javascript change that much.</p>

<p>Hi Andy,<br />
The drag and drop problem is known. It doesn't actually come from Firefox, but from Greasemonkey (that changed it's injection model).<br />
I didn't know about the menu problem thought, I'll check it out. I also suspect it's a problem with the latest version of Greasemonkey.</p>
