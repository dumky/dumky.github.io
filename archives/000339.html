<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/drdul/177248285/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/27/177248285_58fa0cafe2_t.jpg" alt="No through access except bicycles" style="float: right; padding: 10px 0px 0px 20px; width:100; height:80; border: none" /></a> A round of new IE8 features, relating to privacy and user control, was just <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/08/25/ie8-and-privacy.aspx">announced</a>.</p>

<p>Reading the details, it looks to me like the IE team is shipping an ad-blocking software.<br />
Sure, it may not be positioned as such, but that is in effect what they are releasing.</p>

<p>InPrivate Blocking and InPrivate Subscriptions are equivalent to AdBlock Plus and its <a href="http://adblockplus.org/en/faq_features#subscriptions">filter subscriptions</a> feature. <br />
Like AdBlock, the IE team does not need to provide a default list of filters and can wash its hand of what filters may be published for people to subscribe to.</p>

<p>Watching the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Charles/IE-8-Beta-2-Privacy-is-about-more-than-cookies/">Channel 9 discussion on privacy features in IE8</a>, its obvious that these guys are not talking about the elephant in the room.<br />
What are they thinking? Is this a move against Google? Does this genuinely spawn from privacy concerns, while inadvertently and innocently introducing some potentially disruptive side-effects to the ad networks and web analytics businesses?</p>

<p>Again, this is not a <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/000230.html">new issue</a>, but having this feature built in such a user-friendly way into the market-dominant browser is huge. <br />
I'm surprised by the lack of reaction in the blogosphere. What am I missing?</p>

<p><u>Update (2008/08/28):</u> I just installed IE8 beta 2 and it looks like InPrivate Blocking is disabled in normal sessions, and only active during InPrivate sessions. That significantly restricts the impact of the feature.</p>
