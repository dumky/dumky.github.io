In his words, it's an "interactive designer for ruler-and-compass constructions".</p>

<p>Watch the <a href="http://silverlight.services.live.com/invoke/93630/LiveGeometryIntro/iframe.html">5 minute screencast</a> and try the application on <a href="http://livegeometry.com/">livegeometry.com</a>.</p>

<p><br />
Also, check out the class diagram illustrating <a href="http://livegeometry.codeplex.com/documentation">the design</a> (dependency tracking and change propagation, similar to a spreadsheet software and reminiscent of <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/000359.html">reactive programming</a>).</p>

<p>PS: I wish more screencasts were that condensed. Video on the web is too slow ;-)</p>

<p>Sounds ingenius but maybe a bit complex( for me anyway!) but really wantto give it a go, seems like it could be really useful..</p>

<p>That was great, but veery fast :) I think you should make a separate 2 or 5 minute video for each tool that would explain in a slower fashion, what this tool can be used for. E.g. using a point and segment tool to draw a point and segment respectively is rather obvious, but using them to draw a circumcircle requires some deeper reflection :)</p>

<p>Very original! I think it's great.. but it would be nice if it was a little bit slower. But still very interesting and, IMO, very useful. Thanx for sharing!</p>
