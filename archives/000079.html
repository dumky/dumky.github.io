<p>I recently saw a documentary on Science Central that showed amazing images. It showed a caterpillar in the foreground of a crop field, with a plane flying over it, and everything was in focus!<br />
The lens system used in this footage was created by Frazier, a wildlife photographer, and appears to have an un-common depth of field. In practice this means objects that are very close (less than a meter) and other that are very far (the horizon) are in focus simultaneously. Some said it was impossible, from a physics/optics point of view, but apparently Frazier found a solution, that left optics experts clueless.</p>

<p>Beside articles about the patent for this lens system, the one interesting reference I have found so far is "<a href="http://www.theasc.com/magazine/feb99/panavision/pg1.htm">Seeing is believing</a>".<br />
Unfortunately, I could not find downloadable versions of the footages they showed on TV or information about the optics tricks used in this lens system.</p>
<p>During my search, I found this cool <a href="http://www.tecplusplus.de/ManualLu/prisms.htm">page about prisms</a>, where each prism has a 3d illustration of a light beam traversing it.</p>
