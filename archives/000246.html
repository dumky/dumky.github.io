<h2 class="title">Textarea resize user script</h2>

<p>Typing a lot of text, such as blogging or commenting, into small text boxes on a web page is uncomfortable. The following script makes it more comfortable. After you install it, you can enlarge any text box by typing Ctrl-Enter.</p>

<p><a title="right click &#8594; Install User Script..." href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/images/TextareaResize.user.js">TextareaResize</a> is my latest Greasemonkey user script. <br />
It allows you to grow the size of textareas on most websites using the keyboard: while typing in a textarea, press Ctrl-Enter to expand the textarea vertically and Ctrl-Space to make it wider.</p>

<p><u>Update (2005/05/10):</u> Updated to maximize how much of the textarea can be seen: the textarea is brought at the top of the window and won't be resized any larger than the viewport.</p>

<p><u>Update (2005/05/19):</u> Updated the script with the code Matt Sherwood suggested in a comment: Shift-Ctrl-Enter and Shift-Ctrl-Space to shrink the size. I also improved the way the textarea gets centered, using ScrollIntoView.</p>

<p>Great script! Here's a suggested minor enhancement to allow making the TextAreas smaller too (using Shift-Ctrl-Enter, Shift-Ctrl-Space):</p>

<p>(I updated the script with your suggestion, and removed the code from the comment -- Julien)</p>

<p>Kai, that extension is pretty cool. I especially like that way it manages to resize some textareas that my script still can't, that are contained in a fixed size element/div.</p>

<p>But I still like that ability to resize via the keyboard, rather than the mouse ;-)</p>

<p>Yeah, it's pretty good.  I wrote the author (but got no response) to suggest an improvement that would help me out: to be able to switch the wrap attribute between hard and soft and off (also known as virtual/physical or something).  It's a non standard attribute but I've got at least one app I use all the time in which the textarea doesn't wrap right, and it's very annoying :-)  I haven't tried yours, but I'd switch if it had that ability, since using the keyboard is nice too.</p>

<p>This script doesn't seem to work for Firefox on OS X. I really want a script like this, so I'm hoping you or someone can/will get it to work there!</p>

<p>Yes, there is a number of scripts that broke with the latest version of Firefox. I'm going to be on vacation for the next couple of weeks, but I'll fix them when I return.</p>

<p>HI Julian <br />
Your code proved to be very useful but it does not solve my problem.If u can please help.<br />
Description of the problem :<br />
I have a page which has numerous textboxes of fixed size.<br />
This page is required to be printed on click of a button.<br />
we are doing this by opening the same page with all the control by using window.open() function.</p>

<p>Now the problem is ,we have to have the same size of text box in the Main page but when this page is open in PRINT MODE the textbox should be adjustable to accomodate all the content by adjusting the size.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Ex.when the textarea  exceeds the normal size of the box .. a scroll bar is put i.e. if size of TEXTBOX is 5 rows and we include 10 rows of characters,then we get a scrollbar .but when the same page is printed with window.open and print method,only 5 rows of text appears in the PRINT PAGE and other 5 rows remain invisible.<br />
I want to have all 10 Rows Printed on the paper.<br />
Can someone help me.<br />
I am sorry if my problem confused u ..cause it is very difficult to explain it sans an actuall application.<br />
Thanks</p>
