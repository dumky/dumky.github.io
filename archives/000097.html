<p>This is kind of stupid, but if it works it'll be kinda fun (for geeks only): I predict that this <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=lang_en%7Clang_fr&ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&q=self+referential+google+search&btnG=Google+Search">Google search for "Self referential Google search"</a> will find the current page, most likely as the first match.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=Self+referential+Google+search&btnI=I%27m+Feeling+Lucky">"I feel lucky" search for "Self referential Google search"</a> should therefore bring you here.</p>

<p>Of course, this can only work after the page gets indexed by Google, which I expect to occur within 24 hours.<br />
<u>Update:</u> it seems although Google crawls this page every day (and updates its cache) it doesn't index it that often. So it'll take some more time for this experiment to succeed.<br />
<u>Update:</u> Google indexed the page, the self-referential search now works ;-)</p>
<p>I noticed a bunch of TinyURLs somewhere on Slashdot recently and the urls looked predictable, so here is a <a href="http://tinyurl.com/kf8r">self-referential TinyURL</a>. The TinyURL server handles this case fine though and avoids the infinite redirect loop ;-)</p>
