<p>Casey Chesnut wrote an <a href="http://www.brains-n-brawn.com/default.aspx?vDir=aitabletocr">ink/character recognizer using neural networks</a> (via <a href="http://journals.tuxreports.com/lch/archives/002124.html">Incremental Blogger</a>) and seems to be getting pretty good recognition results out of it. <br />
It's a great introduction to neural networks and has many good pointers on the topic. No code is included though.  </p>

<p>The segmentation problem (grouping strokes into characters) is pretty tricky, so he's using the APIs included in the Tablet PC OS to get around it. <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/000012.html">Recognizing unistoke characters only</a> (Graffiti style) is another way to avoid the trouble ;-)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.brains-n-brawn.com/">Casey's website</a> has tons of other cool stuff that I need to dig into, like neural-net-based image grouping or gesture recognition using a webcam.</p>
