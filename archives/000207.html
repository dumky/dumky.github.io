<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365748/">"Shawn of the Dead"</a> is an excellent british zombie / romantic-comedy movie. <br />
My fiancée and I were staying in London for a couple days last week and had some fun making zombie noises in the subway, like the characters in the movie. And we heard some other people too :-) <br />
It made me think that having a greater number of people doing this could create a cool/scary effect. </p>

<p>Why not organize a flashmob were the participants would act like zombies? </p>
<p>London would be a great place to do this. <br />
In order for tourists and other bystanders not to get too freaked out, it would have to only last for a short but well coordinated time. Using the Big Ben bells as a signal and simulating zombies for a minute could be pretty effective, I think.</p>

<p><u>Update (2005/08/01):</u> San Francisco is getting its own <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/07/30/things_to_do_in_sf_w.html">zombie flashmob</a> with a twist: zombies can convert bystanders, so the mob can replicate.</p>

<p>Well... here's one. But it's happening tomorrow, so get your skates on. And your flesh off.</p>

<p>I can see bystanders shooting zombies now...."I thought it was real! You're supposed to shoot zombies, right?"</p>
