<p>I have been using SharpReader for more than a month now. It is a rather simple app (at least UI-wise), but it does the job well. I wonder if the "backend" RSS work is difficult, given the multiple versions of RSS and the interop problems in RSS (that <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/Motivation">motivated necho</a>).</p>

<p>As with all applications you use quite a bit and enjoy, there is always little additions you'd enjoy. So here is my wishlist:</p>
<p>- let me modify SharpReader: I'd love to see some of the code and be able to modify some of it to implement some of my wishes myself. Alternatively, a plugin system might be enough to implement the features listed below.</p>

<p>- sync over the web: I use multiple computers, one at work, one at home and one laptop, but I can only use SharpReader on one of them because it doesn't support synchronization. I don't know if there is existing frameworks (maybe Jabber) to make this easier.</p>

<p>- fix the Back button on the mouse: this button works in other instances of IE, but not in the "mini-browser" in SharpReader. Although SharpReader is not meant to be a full-fledged browser, it is sometimes useful to navigate a couple links and back.</p>

<p>- have an Undo Delete feature: I am sometimes too hasty when deleting a post, and I'd love to be able to undo one deletion. This feature should be bound to the Ctrl-Z shortcut.</p>

<p>- integrate in the browser's handling of the RSS mime type: when I open an RSS file in IE or Mozilla, it'd be nice to have it loaded into SharpReader. This would make subscribing to feeds even easier.</p>

<p>- allow flagging entries: it is sometimes useful to flag entries, besides marking them read or unread.</p>

<p>Also, I have noticed that some entries don't display correctly, instead of loading the description from the feed, it loads on of the urls of the entry. I am not sure yet whether this is a bug or just a problem with the feed itself.</p>

<p>Luke actually has a plugin model. I haven't written one yet, though i plan to do this soon to write a ink blogger plugin. </p>

<p>There is no RSS mime type for most things. It's usually text/xml. </p>

<p>As to your second point - agreed. I'm working on something that will help this, but it would be better if it were integrated - and the UI could be decoupled from the backend, specifically subscriptions.</p>

<p>The current plugin system appears to support IBlogThis and IBlogExtension interfaces, which are meant for blogging about an RSS entry listed by the feed reader, but not general purpose extensions.<br />
I may be missing something though: would you have specific pointers for more information on the interfaces your were considering?</p>

<p>About the second point (having multiple readers synchronize): thinking some more about it, it seems a really general problem (also applies to bookmarks, contacts, notes,...). I have a post in preparation with some reflections/suggestions for a possible framework for handling this.</p>

Richard listed some SharpReader requests of his own. I'm happy to see I'm not the only one with the multiple machines problem.</p>

<p>I wish we didn't have to use a central server to handle these synchronization problems every time (for bookmarks, notes, email,...), but it still is the easiest solution today even if P2P getting lots of interest.</p>

<p>There has been some more discussions on one-click feed subscription (check out <a href="http://www.tallent.us/PermaLink.aspx?guid=6d03b762-9867-4786-8c33-b649efe3160d">http://www.tallent.us/PermaLink.aspx?guid=6d03b762-9867-4786-8c33-b649efe3160d</a> ).</p>

<p>Pete Hopkins is proposing a new URI scheme (feed:) for this. He also posted an interesting comment (<a href="http://pirate.typepad.com/blog/2003/09/problems_with_m.html">http://pirate.typepad.com/blog/2003/09/problems_with_m.html</a>  ) on the conceptual problem of using a mime type to do the job: mime types allow the browser to download the content and pass it to another app, while subscribing would actually require the url itself to be handed to the app.</p>

<p>as for mime type handling, i have this problem myself, but then not all feeds are served with the correct type anyway ;)</p>

<p>something i found useful, was the Launchy extension (for firefox at least) you can add your own apps using an XML file (ie sharpreader, add it as type 1 (browser)) then you can "open with sharpreader" :)</p>
