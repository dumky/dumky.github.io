<p>I just came back from <a href="http://www.ceas.cc/papers-2004/">CEAS 2004</a>, the first conference on email and anti-spam. We were sharing some spam and phishing stories over lunch and one struck me. </p>

<p>It was about somebody's grand'pa that received an email claiming that a fraud had been detected and he had been charged for a large number of flowers. His credit card number was asked to credit the money back to his account. </p>

<p>Not only does it illustrate the problem of phishing and social engineering, but it also made me realize how the credit card design violates the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PrincipleOfLeastPrivilege">POLA principle (Principle Of Least Authority)</a>. A credit card number acts as an unrestricted (albeit monitored) handle to the corresponding account. </p>

<p>Providing his credit card number on that page would have given the attacker more authority than it really needed: that of crediting money but also that of charging some, once or more.<br />
Yet, we keep giving it around... </p>

<p>A better design would allow giving out one use charge-only or debit-only handle, for single or multiple uses. <br />
The granularity level is still a matter of discussion, but it could be adapted later if needed.</p>

<p>One other open matter is how to build a usable solution?<br />
What if instead of a passive card, you had a card that allowed you to punch in the options you want (mainly the amount)? You would then input your card number as usual, but also a confirmation code (maybe 3 or 4 digits) that would be cryptographically express the limited authority you want to give out.</p>

<p>The concept of <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1017-245428.html">disposable credit card numbers</a> is already being used.</p>
