<p><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/users/benaloh/">Josh Benaloh</a> mentioned Visual Cryptography in a talk last week. I had no idea what that was, so I did a quick investigation. <br />
It turns out visual cryptography is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_sharing">secret sharing</a> scheme where no computer is needed for the decoding. Instead, a human can extract the secret by combining the parts visually. A common example for parts is <a href="http://www.security.unisa.it/VISUAL/VCRYPT/examples.html">black and white patterns printed on transparencies</a>. <br />
It supports threshold schemes, where the secret information isn't revealed or recovered unless a minimum number of parts are put together.</p>
