<p>I got hit by large waves of comment spam in the last couple weeks. I apologize for any reader that was offended. The spamming got worse after I added the "last comments" section to the front page.</p>

<p>At first I just activated the "Email new comments" MovableType feature and was deleting the spam manually. That quickly became painful.<br />
I then tried the solution of <a href="http://www.classy.dk/log/archive/000874.html">having a "delete comment" link in the email</a>, but for some reason that link wouldn't display correctly in Outlook.</p>

<p><br />
<b>MT blacklist</b><br />
I'm not sure why I didn't use <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/projects/mt-blacklist/">Jay Allen's MT-blacklist</a> plugin earlier, even though I knew about it. It turned out to be super easy to install. It's been tremendously helpful to me so far.<br />
It also includes a link in the email notification for new comments, but that one works fine in Outlook.</p>

<p>One problem is that I've had to blacklist some very short keywords like "mom", "son" and "rape" which started triggering false positives (for example, a comment with "scraped" got flagged). Having a way to exempt a comment from the filtering would be good.</p>

<p><br />
<b>What's next?</b><br />
Sifry also wonders about the <a href="http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000351.html">blog comment spam solutions and the coming arms race</a>. </p>

<p>I think most of distributed moderation systems will come down to two parts: some form of identification and some form of reputation. </p>

<p>The identification could use your home url, a PGP key, a TypeKey or Passport account... </p>

<p>The reputation could be handled centrally by technorati, in the case that Sifry discusses (where technorati binds the comment posts to the original post).<br />
But you could also have a binary reputation using LOAF and blogrolls: you publish a size efficient list of IDs (whatever they are) that you specifically trust and a list of IDs you specifically don't, and you combine these with the lists published by the other blog owners you trust (your blogroll).<br />
The remaining problem is how to handle comments/commenters that don't fall in either category, because they are unknown from the system. These probably still need to be manually approved or at least continue to be filtered.</p>
<p><u>Update:</u> Get the latest MT-blacklist version, that fixes a flaw regarding <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/comment_spam/2004/05/mtblacklist_v164_released">escaped characters</a>.</p>

<p>Comment spammers have not found me. I guess that my pages do not rank high enough on Google...</p>
