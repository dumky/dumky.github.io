<h2 class="title">Dynamic Proxy Classes</h2>

<p>O'Reilly network had an article on uses of <a href="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/08/20/memoization.html">dynamic proxies to implement generic memoizing</a>, in Java.</p>

<p>Dynamic proxies are an interesting construct, that appeared in Java 1.3. Here is the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/Proxy.html">JDK documentation for the Proxy class</a>. <br />
Basically, they allow defining a class at runtime that implements any interfaces you want and funnels all its method calls to an InvocationHandler. All the InvocationHandler has to implement the generic <i>Object invoke(Object proxiedObject, Method method, Object[] args)</i> method.</p>

<a name="more"></a>
<p><b>Java uses of dynamic proxy classes</b><br />
<u>Interface tracing</u><br />
Proxies can be used for method tracing, as shown <a href="http://www.jasonbock.net/javadynamicproxies.html">here</a>. <br />
Note that only methods are proxied, not member variables (which can't be specified in interfaces anyway). But that means that you don't completely proxy the object and thus can't use a proxy to trace member variable access.<br />
Although the code to add a proxy to a class is really small <br />
(something like <i>IPerson tracePerson = (IPerson)LogProxyFactory.logObject(new Person("Jason", "Bock", 29));</i>), as Jason states, it may be inconvenient. But he doesn't have a solution to avoid it.</p>

<p><u>Delegates implementation</u><br />
Delegates can be emulated thru the use of reflection and dynamic proxy classes. Find it in O'Reilly's <a href="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/05/21/delegates.html">"A Java Programmer Looks at C# Delegates"</a>.<br />
Although it is interesting to see how it is done, I think the overhead of using this framework just to bridge the "delegates vs. inner class" gap is overkill. Especially since interfaces are still needed for the compile-time type-safety (see scenario 2.). This remains an emulation and feels like one.</p>

<p>I haven't looked at the source yet, but CGLib has an implementation of <a href="http://cglib.sourceforge.net/apidocs/net/sf/cglib/MethodDelegate.html">method delegates</a>. According to <a href="http://sixlegs.com/blog/java/delegates-history.html">Chris</a> it still relies on reflection, but should eventually be switched to runtime byte-code emission via BCEL (Byte Code Engineering Library), for a better invocation performance, traded against a slower creation.</p>

<b>.NET dynamic proxy classes</b><br />
A dynamic proxy generator or factory can be written in .NET using Reflection.Emit, as described <a href="http://www.dotnetguru.org/articles/dossiers/instrumentation/proxiesdynamiques.htm">here (sorry, link is in French)</a>.</p>

<p><br />
<b>Memoizing</b><br />
Is there a way to implement a generic memoizing solution in .NET?</p>

<p>I first thought that generics (in C# 2.0 and already available in Rotor and Mono) and delegates should allow for an even cleaner implementation of a re-usable memoizing component. You would make a delegate out of the method you want to memoize and then use a memoizer object using the method's delegate as it's parameterized type.<br />
But trying to lay down the interface for the Memoizer, this seems like a tricky problem. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Ideally we'd want the Memoizer to take a method delegate and return a memoized delegate. The Memoizer object would hold a cache using the delegate's return type as its parameterized type.<br />
There are two problems:<br />
- how to type parameterize the cache so that it matches the delegates return value type?<br />
- how to have the Memoizer expose and implement a method with the same interface as the delegate?</p>

<p><u>Type parameterizing the cache</u><br />
I can think of two approaches for this. Either there should be a way of make a reference to a delegates return type or there should be a way to constrain a delegates return type to match some other type.<br />
For example, the first solution would mean writing <i>Memoizer&lt;DelegateType></i> and <i>Cache&lt;DelegateType.returnType> map;</i> <br />
The other solution would be having <i>Memoizer&lt;DelegateType, CacheType> memoizer</i> with some way of enforcing that DelegateType's return type would be CacheType. I remember reading somewhere about constraining delegates interfaces, but I couldn't find it again. I'll add it here if I do.</p>

<p><u>Expose a method with parameterized signature</u><br />
The problem is to expose and implement a new method with the parameterized DelegateType's signature. A possible solution might be to have something like a runtime-generated dynamic proxy that would match a delegate instead of an interface as we have seen in the case of Java.<br />
This means the Memoizer would implement the InvocationHandler interface and you would write <i>Proxy.newProxyInstance(&lt;DelegateType>, new Memoizer&lt;DelegateType>(origDelegate)</i>. All calls to this runtime generated delegate would be funneled (via some JIT trick) to the Memoizer's generic <i>object Invoke(object proxiedObject, MethodInfo method, object[] params)</i> where it could be handled using reflection.</p>
