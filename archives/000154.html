<p>Here are some input/output gadgets that look pretty cool:<br />
<ul><li>A pen-shaped document scanner: <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&u=/ap/20040315/ap_on_hi_te/tech_test_docupen">DocuPen</a>. I wonder if software could put the page back together, removing the distortions.</li><br />
<li>A <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,5184,5787,00.html">pen input device for cellphones</a> from Nokia. I wonder why more smartphones don't allow sending ink messages yet, since it seems more convenient than digipad typing.</li><br />
<li>One more <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/the_data_glass_2_wearable_display.php">head mounted display</a>. Although I really look forward to having one of these and nearly bought a <a href="http://www.microopticalcorp.com/Products/HomePage.html">SV-6 from MicroOptical</a>, the social pressure of looking seriously weird is still too strong ;-)</li><br />
<li><a href="http://arstechnica.com/news/posts/1075140852.html">Production-ready e-paper from Philips</a> (see the <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/rollable_display_video.php">video</a>). It feels like e-paper has been "nearly done" for longer than Duke Nukem Forever now and I'm still waiting for an actual consumer device from <a href="http://www.eink.com/">E-Ink</a>.</li><br />
<li>Wearable keyboards like <a href="http://www.senseboard.com/product.php">SenseBoard</a> or <a href="http://www.lightglove.com/">LightGlove</a> (via <a href="http://www.i4u.com/article966.html">I4U</a>). I also own a <a href="http://www.halfkeyboard.com/">HalfKeyboard</a> and just ordered a <a href="http://store.yahoo.com/ibizpda/vike.html">Virtual Keyboard</a>.</li></ul></p>
<p><u>Update:</u> There is also the <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/03/07/1420208">matchbox sized projector</a> ;-)<br />
I also forgot digital pens like Logitech's <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/features/digitalwriting/US/EN,CRID=1545">io pen</a>, but it's still too bulky and could use some support for converting to Tablet PC's ink.<br />
Another wearable display: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1524298107675165/">Second Sight</a>.</p>

<p><u>Update:</u> I just saw the sixth episode of "24" (third season) and noticed that Chase wears a MicroOptical wearable display. Cool ;-)</p>
