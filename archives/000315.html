<p>Neil Mix implemented a cool solution to do <a href="http://www.neilmix.com/2007/02/07/threading-in-javascript-17/">threading in javascript</a>. It achieves a specific kind of multi-threading, with voluntary yielding and interleaved execution, which is different than what C++, Java or C# offer (preemptive multi-threading). </p>

<p>The idea is that the code for each "thread" needs to voluntarily interrupt its processing flow to let another thread execute for a while. When a thread suspends its execution, its state is saved. When the thread is later awoken, it continues its processing from where it stopped.</p>
<p>To understand Neil's library, you first need to learn how to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generator_%28computer_science%29">generators</a>. Generators are a new construct in javascript 1.7 (available in Firefox 2.0) which let your write a piece of code returning a sequence of results, pausing its execution for each result and restarting from its paused state to compute the next result. </p>

<p>Normally, a function that receives execution control keeps it until it returns. But with generators, the execution control can be given up in the middle of the routine and later restored.<br />
One way to look at it is that the code in the generator is dependent on the caller to call repeatedly to activate each "segment" of the processing. </p>

<p>Some sample code will help you grop generators (taken from Brendan Eich's quick <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/presentations/javascript2/#slide39">description of generators</a>): <br />
<quote><br />
<ul><li>"yield" in a function makes a generator:</li><br />
      function count(n : int) {<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++)<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    yield i;<br />
      }<br />
<li>A generator function returns an iterator, which exposes a method called "next":</li><br />
      var gen = count(10);<br />
      gen.next(); // returns 0; <br />
      . . .; <br />
      gen.next(); // returns 9<br />
      gen.next(); // throws StopIteration<br />
<li>Iterators also support "send" and "throw" methods:</li><br />
    gen.send(value); // passes value back to yield<br />
    gen.throw(exception); // throws exception from yield <br />
</ul><br />
</quote></p>

<p>As you can see, generators offer much of what's needed to let our "threads" relinquish control, pause and restart, at least if our threads are single functions. <br />
But if you need to have sub-functions called as part of the thread, generators fall short. As Neil puts it: "generators are unable to yield across multiple frames in the callstack".</p>

<p>This is where his library comes in. It lets you write generators which call sub-generators, and it saves the state of an entire thread, when it gets paused, as a stack of paused generators. <br />
The framework takes care of adding a new stack frame when a generator returns a sub-generator, lets the sub-generator segments get executed, and passes the value or exception returned by the sub-generator back to the calling frame (see gen.send(value) function above). <br />
This is called trampolining generators. </p>

<p>Here's a code example for a thread, when using the library. Note that "sleep" "waitForInput" and "animateUI" are themselves generators (ie. they use the "yield" keyword).<br />
<div class="code">function myThreadedCall() {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;    while (!ready) {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      yield sleep(100);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;    }<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;    yield waitForInput();<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;    if ((yield post(getInput())) != null ) {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      yield animateUI();<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;    }<br />
  }</div></p>

<p>Obviously, making use of this multi-threading technique comes with a peculiar coding style, where you have to indicate explicit yield points. This approach does however avoid some of the more complex concurrency problems (atomic operations on shared state).</p>

<p>It is good to see how the limits of javascript getting challenged with every incremental feature added to the language. And even though I haven't used this approach and I don't know if I'm going to use it any time soon, the technique is fascinating and definitely great mental exercise. <br />
The <a href="http://www.neilmix.com/demos/js17threading/Thread.js">library code</a> is pretty small, about 150 lines of code, and is worth reading to get a better sense of the trampoline design.</p>
