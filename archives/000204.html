<p>Phil Ringnalda and Ian Hickson are thinking about <a href="http://philringnalda.com/blog/2004/08/time_for_an_untrusted_content_element.php">extending HTML with search engine hinting tags</a>.<br />
I totally agree with this, as I <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/000109.html#htmlhinting">mentioned before</a>. The questions are whether the attribute should be on a block or on individual links, whether we should have more general link typing or simply "vote abstain" ("vote against" is a bad idea), and whether Google could handle it.</p>

<p>For authors, the most useful seems to have an "unendorsed" or "nofollow" tag for blocks. Supporting that tag on a link level is definitely lower priority.<br />
For Google, I would expect that a tag on the link would be easier to handle, parsing-wise. I really wish the Google people would chime in on this.</p>

<p>I was also glad to hear that <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/000109.html#htmlhinting">finer level indexing hints</a> actually <a href="http://www.michaelhanscom.com/eclecticism/2004/08/untrusted_conte.html">exist and implemented in some search engines (FDSE)</a>, but again Google doesn't not seem to have responded to these suggestions.</p>
<p><u>Update:</u> Some indications that Google is <a href="/archives/000225.html">making a move</a>.</p>
