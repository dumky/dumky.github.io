<p>Looking for some mechanical puzzles (which I love), I ended up on the <a href="http://dmoz.org/Games/Puzzles/Mechanical/">DMOZ Puzzles page</a>. And it has a sub-section for Rube Goldberg machines (see <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/000036.html">this previous entry</a> for an example).<br />
That's how I found this <a href="http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/marbles/index.html"> Matthias's marble machines page</a> which explains a couple simple but neat principles that he used for the marble machine 1 and 2: a simple marble flip-flop and two marble pumps to brings the marbles back at the top.</p>

<p>It's quite fun to try and figure out other ways to brings the marbles back at the top. Can you come up with some non-trivial ones of your own?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.kugelbahn.ch/">http://www.kugelbahn.ch/</a> has links to many other kinetic art websites, with an endless supply of sculptures, automaton and games.</p>
