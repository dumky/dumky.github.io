<p>Here are two kinds malware that caught my attention recently, which I had never thought about:<br />
<ul><li><a href="http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/pwsteal.wowcraft.html">World of Warcraft password stealing trojan</a> (via <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/08/stealing_imagin.html">Bruce Schneier</a>), most likely to make money off of selling the virtual goods, </li><li>"Ransomware" (via <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.08/start.html?pg=6">Wired</a>), encrypting valuable files on the infected machine and selling the decryption keys. </li></ul><br />
These fit the trend of the last couple of years, the <a href="http://acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=printer_friendly&pid=316&page=1">rise of profit as a motive for attacks</a>. Profit definitely changes the threat modelling picture: for example, the traditional threat of sensitive documents being leaked or deleted morphs into extortion. I guess the mitigation stays the same in that case though: make backups.<br />
I wonder what other kind of wacky or imaginative attacks hackers are coming up with these days and we may not even know anything about yet. <br />
