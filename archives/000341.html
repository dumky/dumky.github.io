<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/balakov/1544234007/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2257/1544234007_dd7686d788_t.jpg" alt="Spaghetti Code" style="float: right; padding: 0px 0px 0px 10px; width:100; height:65; border: none" /></a> The 'beautify-js' command makes it easy to format javascript code. <br />
This is useful when you develop a Ubiquity command in the Ubiquity editor (chrome://ubiquity/content/editor.html).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/000341.html">Read on</a> to install.</p>
<p><link rel="commands" href="http://jcouv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Ubiquity/beautify-js.js" name="Beautify JS" /><br />
 <br />
By now, the Ubiquity prompt should have appeared at the top of the page (saying "This page contains Ubiquity commands. If you'd like to subscribe to them, please click on the button to the right."). <br />
If the notification does not appear, make sure that you have installed the Ubiquity add-on.</p>

<p>After you install the command, open any page with a textarea containing javascript, select the code then run the Ubiquity command "beautify-js". <br />

<p>It broke for me. I copied the source from <a href="http://ubiquitously.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=30">http://ubiquitously.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=30</a> into the command editor and ran beautify-js on it, but it lost half the contents! :(</p>

<p>Thanks panda. I can repro the issue.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if it is a problem with the javascript which you are trying to beautify, or the beautify-js command. Let me investigate to figure it out.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if this happens, you can revert the beautification with Undo (Ctrl-Z).</p>

<p>Hi Julien, just a thank you - the script seems to work really well and hasn't broken anything (yet :P)</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
