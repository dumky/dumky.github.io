<p>Found on <a href="http://nooface.com/articles/03/06/19/223254.shtml">NooFace</a>: wear a little camera and with a touch of a button, save the previous 30 seconds (audio+video) to a memory card (in mpeg4).<br />
The most expensive model allows up to 4 hours recordings.<br />
Check it out on <a href="http://www.mydejaview.com">DejaView's site</a> (in the products section).</p>

<p>The camera (320x240pixels, 24bits) seems a bit large, but the main unit seems reasonnably small (like a cellphone) and has USB connectivity.</p>
<p><u>Update:</u> CamWear is getting <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/6551235144622112/">closer to shipping</a>, as a camera manufacturer signs the deal.</p>

<p><u>Update:</u> Some reflections on how such small cameras can be used to provide <a href="http://www.dansdata.com/gz038.htm">distributed recording of events</a> (like riots) to prove how things occured and <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/10/25/1849226">discussions</a> on the social changes that these "SnitchCams" could create.</p>

<p><u>Update:</u> The first <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,118587,pg,1,RSS,RSS,00.asp">review of the CamWear 100</a> is available (<a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1017025367179893/">via</a>).</p>
