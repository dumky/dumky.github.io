<p>Here's another small script, <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/images/MSDN-FixTitles.user.js" title="right click &#8594; Install User Script...">"MSDN - Fix Titles"</a> which fixes the title on a number of MSDN pages.</p>

<p>Instead of something generic, the script tries to find a more specific title from the content frames.<br />
In this <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dndotnet/html/versremote.asp?frame=true&hidetoc=true">example</a>, "Welcome to the MSDN Library" gets replaced with a more relevant and usable title: "MSDN: Side-By-Side and Versioning Considerations for .NET Remoting".</p>

<p>at first, I meant to ask why don't you post it in <a href="http://userscripts.org,">http://userscripts.org,</a> but then I saw you already did in <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/3349">http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/3349</a> so now I wonder why you don't link to this entries in your user scripts posts.</p>

<p>In addition, I htink I found a similar script that does it in an arguably more elegant way - <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/2587">http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/2587</a></p>

<p>Thanks for the pointer Splintor, I definitely should have checked the userscript database first :-)</p>

<p>I agree the other script is cleaner. Mine was put together really quickly: I didn't want to worry with the XPCNativeWrapper injection changes (thus the injectMe method) and didn't spend long reverse-engineering the urls for MSDN ;-)</p>
