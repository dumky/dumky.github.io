<p>Now that I've written a couple of "Single Page View" user scripts, I'm getting increasingly impatient when I encounter sites that break articles onto multiple pages. <br />
It really seems like a disservice to users, forcing them to interrupt their reading to navigate to the next page (clicking and loading time). I suppose it's mainly a trick to display more ads. I'd rather simply scroll down with the space bar or a flick of the mouse wheel.</p>

<p>So here's one more Greasemonkey script, this time for ArsTechnica: <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/images/ArsTechnica-SinglePageView.user.js" title="right click &#8594; Install User Script...">ArsTechnica - Single Page View</a>.</p>

<p>Any other similar sites that could use a little bit of cutting and splicing?</p>
<p><u>Update (2006/01/18): </u> It looks like ArsTechnica changed their format and this script is now broken. Christopher Campbell published an updated version: <a href="http://userscripts.com/scripts/show/2669">ArsTechnica - Multi-page viewer</a>.</p>

<p>These separate pages are freaking me out. I hate clicking and waiting till a new page appeares. And when I want to copy and past something I can not do it all at once and on top of that I can not read off line.</p>
