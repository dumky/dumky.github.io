<p>Two cool recursive flash animations via Boing Boing: <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/10/06/zoomquilt_is_a_fanta.html">Zoomquilt</a> and an <a href="http://www.mcescher.com/Gallery/recogn-bmp/LW410.jpg">Escher-style</a> <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/12/06/recursive_animation_.html">self-portrait (and diy tutorial)</a>. </p>

<p>It reminds me of one of my grandpa's toys: a tube, printed on the inside (a cartoonish drawing), in which you could slide a shiny sphere (positioned on the tip of a second tube, to hold it). <br />
That spherical mirror created an anamorphosis effect. Sliding it created a zoom effect. <br />
I haven't seen it in a while and couldn't find a picture of it on the web. But from what I remember it started with the same image as it ended with, suggesting recursion. </p>

<p>Btw, more resources on <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/mc-escher">Escher</a>.</p>
