<p>The 'insert-link' command let's you find and insert a url from your history.<br />
Finding the url works just like the AwesomeBar. As you type characters, matches from your history get displayed. Then you can select which one you want to insert.</p>

<p><link rel="commands" href="http://jcouv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Ubiquity/insert-link.js" name="Insert link" /><br />
Here's a screenshot of this command in action:<br />

 <br />
For comparison, here is a screenshot of the AwesomeBar showing the same suggestions as the 'insert-link' verb:<br />

<h4>Installation</h4><br />
By now, the Ubiquity prompt should have appeared at the top of the page offering you to install the insert-js command.</p>

<p>After you install the command, open any page with a textarea, run the Ubiquity command "insert-link" and start filtering your history. <br />
 <br />
<h4>Internals</h4><br />
This command is based off the <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/nsIAutoCompleteController">nsIAutoCompleteController</a> service. The unittests in the Firefox source tree are very handy to learn how to operate that API (in this case, the examples came from firefox-3.0.1-source\mozilla\toolkit\components\places\tests\unit\test_000_frecency.js).</p>

<p>I must say that it is exciting to have access to the guts the browser like that. Experimentation is much easier with the command editor than writing full-fledged extensions, at least for simple things. <br />
On the other hand, the debugging experience could be improved. I have not found how to debug commands or inspect the styling of the previews. <br />
Also, this level of access poses a clear security risk, which will be an interesting challenge to address moving forward.</p>

<p>I can't believe someone *actually* made this. Totally awesome! I'm going to use this all the time when typing emails.</p>

<p>This is great! I've been desiring this command for a while now.</p>

<p>We really need to figure out how to do keyboard access in the preview area (or you should implement the links as a noun type).</p>

<p>Hi Aza, <br />
I tried implementing the links as noun type, but there are two problems doing it that way:<br />
-suggestions have to be provided synchronously. The suggestions from the Places engine come back asynchronously.<br />
-suggestions do not allow rich content (yet) . I need to display some text, a link and a favicon in the suggestions for this verb.</p>

<p>Can we get more than 6 entries in preview pane?</p>

<p>@DualSighter: you can easily modify the script to display more than 6 entries. <br />
Another option would be to add a "show more" link at the bottom of the preview to expand the list as needed.</p>
