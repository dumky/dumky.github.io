Computation can take many forms. Those diverse embodiments illustrate the common engineering discipline of taking basic building blocks, whose outputs are determined by inputs, and chaining them together. Some are digital (two values/states), while some are analog.
For instance, you can make  AND or OR circuits with dominoes ([explanation]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNuPy-r1GuQ)), and combine them into a large domino circuit that adds two numbers ([demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpLU__bhu2w)).
Similarly, you can add numbers with an elaborate gravity-powered marble machine (see [Gravicomp](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/themakershow/The-Maker-Show-Mini-GraviComp-Mechanical-Computer)) compose of a few primitive blocks.
On the other end of the spectrum, there are analog computation machines, such as those in WWII artillery ([training video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7OqGXp3b7U)), composed of cams shaped after certain functions, differential or multiplying or integrating gear assemblies and linkages. 
Some are an interesting blend, like the CURTA pocket calculator ([demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0cGjC62XRQ), [how it works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loI1Kwed8Pk)).
