Computation can take many forms. Here are a few embodiments which combine ingenuity and discipline. They all illustrate the common engineering discipline of taking basic building blocks (outputs determined by inputs) and chaining them together.

You can make AND or OR circuits with dominoes ([explanation]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNuPy-r1GuQ)), and combine them into a large domino circuit that adds two numbers ([demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpLU__bhu2w)).

Similarly, you can add numbers with a gravity-powered marble machine (see [Gravicomp](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/themakershow/The-Maker-Show-Mini-GraviComp-Mechanical-Computer)) compose of a few primitive blocks.

There are also analog computation machines, such as those in WWII artillery ([training video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7OqGXp3b7U)), composed of cams shaped after certain functions, differential or multiplying or integrating gear assemblies and linkages. 

Some are an interesting blend, like the CURTA pocket calculator ([demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0cGjC62XRQ), [how it works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loI1Kwed8Pk)).
