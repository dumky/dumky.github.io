Computation can take many forms. Here are a few ingenius embodiments. They all illustrate the common engineering discipline of taking basic building blocks (outputs determined by inputs) and chaining them together.

You can make AND or OR circuits with dominoes ([explanation]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNuPy-r1GuQ)), and combine them into a large domino circuit that adds two numbers ([demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpLU__bhu2w)).

Similarly, you can add numbers with a gravity-powered marble machine (see [Gravicomp](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/themakershow/The-Maker-Show-Mini-GraviComp-Mechanical-Computer)) compose of a few primitive blocks.

There are also analog computation machines, such as those in WWII artillery ([training video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7OqGXp3b7U)), composed of cams shaped after certain functions, differential or multiplying or integrating gear assemblies and linkages. 

Some are an interesting blend, like the CURTA pocket calculator ([demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0cGjC62XRQ), [how it works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loI1Kwed8Pk)).

One aspect that is interesting is how each design offers a different trade-off for what is fixed and what is "configurable". Even within narrow category of electronic implementations you can find this trade-off, with specialized circuits (less configurable), general purpose CPU (logic is "configured" by each instruction), and hybrid solutions like FPGAs (part of the configuration can only be updated by a relatively slow process).
Looking ahead to wetware like the brain, I think that's one of the big questions. What is fixed (determined by DNA), what is almost fixed (common structure and specialization of modules that emerge from those primitives interacting with the regularities of the world), what is malleable (configurable but slowly, like learning a new language) and what is configurable/learnt on the fly (learning a new word or idea). 

Looking ahead,
