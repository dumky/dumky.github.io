title: Using C# 7.1
---

C# 7.0 was released as part of Visual Studio 2017. While we started working on C# 8.0, we will also ship features that are ready sooner as point releases.
C# 7.1 is the first such release. It will ship along with Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3. Thanks to the revamped install experience, you can now quickly and safely [install the Visual Studio Preview](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/preview/) side-by-side.
As you start using new C# 7.1 features in your code, a lightbulb will offer you to upgrade your project, either to "C# 7.1" or "latest". If you leave your project's language version set to "default", you can only use C# 7.0 features ("default" means the latest major version, so does not include point releases).

You can find more details about C# 7.1 and our progress on C# 7.2 and 8.0 in the [language feature status page](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/master/docs/Language%20Feature%20Status.md).
