Some notes on Milton Shapiro chapter on neoclassical models of competition (perfect competition, monopoly, oligopoly and competitive monopoly) in "Foundations of the Market Price System".

The assumption of perfect competition are unrealistic not just because they are extreme (large number of firms, homogenous products,  perfect knowledge), but that some are directionally wrong. In the real world, where we have most competition is where we also have product differentiation.  
Also, in the PC model, there is no rivalry on prices or quality. Incentive for firms to lower prices or innovate have disappeared because of perfect knowledge (they get copied immediately).  
The PC model also implies homogeneity and fungibility of labor.  
For me the biggest issue is that to reach it's conclusion (PC production structure produces larger quantity at lowest price), the model also assumes that the cost curve of small firms is the same as that of larger ones. Basically it ignores economies of scale. One can produce one car just as efficiently as one thousand.  
Artificial definition of market. Everything competes for consumer dollars.  
Static view.  

Only one assumption of the PC model still stands, open entry to the market. This is the main way to improve benefits to the consumer, as Shapiro expounds in chapter X and Rothbard and Mises have also established before him.

I'll quote Shapiro's final remark:
> There is a case to be made against certain tendencies in corporate behavior, but it has little to do with atomism or sloping demand schedules [which are the core of PC model]; it has more to do with business' tendency to run to government for protection whevener the going gets rough in competition at home and abroad.
