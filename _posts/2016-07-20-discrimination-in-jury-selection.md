## Discrimination in jury selection

I have to say that when you explained the statistics, I thought "yep, this is clear evidence of bigotry and prejudice".
But upon reflection, I'm less sure.

Jury selection requires attorneys to be selective and discriminate: they want to choose the juries that will increase their chances of winning.
They will use many factors to evaluate good picks: answers provided, background, behavior, and more.
If an attorney is bigoted, he will prioritize his prejudice for skin color (or some other irrational factor) ahead of his goal (increase his chances of winning). His selection will be worse. 
So, assuming that excluding black juries changes the perspectives represented on the jury and affects the outcomes trials, then being bigoted must hurt this attorney's win-rate.
This would hurt his career relative to more rational attorneys or firms.

Given that trials are highly rivalrous and competitive and that jury selection is important part of the trial, it is hard for me to assume that attorneys are so incompetent and are granting the other party such an easy advantage. This makes the bigotry thesis less likely in my opinion.
The alternative thesis is that the observed outcome is driven by rational reasons. The podcast explained a few possible such reasons.

What kind of evidence would let us evaluate and distinguish those two theses?

Although those may not be conclusive data points either (given how hard it is to tell bigotry apart from rational choice), here are some I'd be curious about:
- is it prosecutors or defendants that tend to reject black juries most commonly?
- do black attorneys tend to reject black juries less, on average?
- do attorneys that keep blacks on their juries win their cases more, on average?
- in an experiment, if you train some attorneys with this knowledge, do their win-rate performance improve?
