I watched Branagh's Cinderella (Disney, 2015) last weekend and am curious to get the perspective of some parents.  
I would definitely advise adult supervision and discussion for kids to watch this movie (as with previous versions of this tale and many other supposed kids movies).  

Without going into the savior prince clich√©, three observations of the kinds of poor choices and values displayed:  

1. The dad seems sensitive and reasonably smart, yet he brings very poor quality people (stepmother and two daughters) into his and his daughter's life. That's very poor judgement. Strangely, Ella  doesn't seem to hold him responsible in any way.  

2. Ella decides to stay in an abusive situation, rather than find another job and home. That's not courage. She obviously has many skills and is hard-working. Yet when a former maid offers to help find a better place, Ella argues that she loves the house and needs to look after it after her parents passed away. Clearly, her parents did not communicate proper priorities (daughter's well-being first, house distant second).  

3. Ella ends up forgiving the stepmother. That is not kindness, but perpetuating the abuse. Excusing and showing empathy towards a sociopath means the sociopath wins and has power of you. The stepmother not only has caused a lot of harm, there was no indication that she recognized it or felt sorry. So, Ella's forgiveness of persistent evil raises the question of whether she will remain alert and able to protect herself in the future.

It's important to recognize when the two virtues promoted in the story (courage and kindness) are being manipulated and distorted to allow for abuse to continue. Such confusion is what allows abuse in the first place.

Let me know what you think.
