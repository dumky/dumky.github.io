title: Simon for Particle Photon
published: false

I received a [Particle Photon](https://store.particle.io/?product=particle-photon) this week-end. It's an amazing little device, and cheap too (19$ without the shield). It has a number of digital I/O ports and one analog, as well as built-in wi-fi (for deploying your code, receiving commands, publishing data and other TCP communications) and serial communication through USB.   
My first project with the just-released [Internet Button shield](https://store.particle.io/?product=internet-button) (11 LEDs, 4 buttons, an accelerometer and more) was a toy game, Simon. That required no additional hardware or assembly, just software.  
The code is available as a library in the Particle web-based IDE (look for "Simon") and also on [github](https://github.com/dumky/simon).  

Beyond that, some ideas I have so far: building a self-balancing mini-Segway with servo motors, or an USB extension for mobile devices (but the USB host capability is not yet built into the firmware), or an IR remote.
