## Simon

I received a Particle Photon this week-end. It's an amazing little device, and cheap too (19$ without the shield). It has a number of digital I/O ports and one analog, as well as built-in wi-fi (for deploying your code, receiving commands, publishing data and other TCP communications) and serial communication through USB.   
My first project with the Internet Button shield (11 LEDs, 4 buttons, an accelerometer and more) was a toy game, Simon. That required no additional hardware or assembly, just software. The code is available as a library in the Particle IDE and also on [github](https://github.com/dumky/simon).  
Beyond that, some ideas I have so far: building a self-balancing mini-Segway with servo motors, or an USB extension for mobile devices (but the USB host capability is not yet built into the firmware), or an IR remote.
