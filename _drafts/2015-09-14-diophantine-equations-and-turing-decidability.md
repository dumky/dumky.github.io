Diophantine equations and Turing decidability

Diophantine equations are polynomials with integer constants and solutions.
They can be used to define Diophantine sets. To do so, you separate the variables of the polynomial into parameters and unknowns. Then the set of parameter values such that the polynomial's unknowns can be solved is called a Diophantine set.  
And any set for which you can find such a polynomial is a Diophantine set.

For instance, the set of even numbers is Diophantine because it is represented by polynomial a - 2x = 0 (where a is a parameter and x an unknown).

The union and intersection of Diophantine sets is also Diophantine.
FirstPolynomial^2 + SecondPolynomial^2 = 0
FirstPolynomial * SecondPolynomial = 0

Step by step, you can show that more complex sets are Diophantine, such as the set of exponentials (for any a and n, {a, a^n}) or the set of prime numbers.
