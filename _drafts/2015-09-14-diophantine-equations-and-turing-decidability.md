Diophantine equations and Turing decidability

Diophantine equations are polynomials with integer constants and solutions.
They can be used to define Diophantine sets. To do so, you separate the variables of the polynomial into parameters and unknowns. Then the set of parameter values such that the polynomial's unknowns can be solved is called a Diophantine set. 

For instance, the set of even numbers
