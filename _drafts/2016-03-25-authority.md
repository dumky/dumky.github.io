I watched some relatively recent movies which tackle the theme of obedience to authority and the corruption to power. All three are quite chilling if not outright disturbing. They show how far many people go where guided by "authority" or granted authority themselves.
Ethical constraints have limited progress. One open question is what factors (if any) shield individuals from such influence. As much as we each think we are immune, the statistical evidence points to the contrary.

## Experimenter (2015)
[Experimenter](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3726704/) depicts the famous Stanley Milgram experiments: unknowing participants are set up in a fake teacher-learner experiment where they are asked to shock the learner (a conferedate with a recorded performance who fails to learn on purpose) with increasing voltage. The question is whether the participants in their roles as "teachers/zappers" will go all the way to the apparently fatal shocks.
It is probably the better established result of the experiments I'll cover, due to its robustness (multiple variants producing similar results) and reproducibility (although very few have been attempted due to ethical concerns of the possible psychological effects on participants). Milgram was trying to understand how the attrocities of nazi Germany could happen.

## The Stanford Prison Experiment (2015)
[The Standord Prison Experiment](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420293/) tells the story of Philip Zimbardo's experiment at Stanford. The synopsis: "Twenty-four male students out of seventy-five were selected to take on randomly assigned roles of prisoners and guards in a mock prison situated in the basement of the Stanford psychology building".
The original experiment was interrupted early, as things turned bad very fast. I don't know that this experiment was repeated. The movie was very disturbing.

## Compliance (2012)
[Compliance](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1971352/) describes a scam that was perpertrated on multiple fast food joints [over 70 times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strip_search_phone_call_scam). In short: "When a prank caller claiming to be a police officer convinces a fast food restaurant manager to interrogate an innocent young employee, no one is left unharmed."
Obviously, this is the most sketchy and unethical, as far as scientific rigor.
