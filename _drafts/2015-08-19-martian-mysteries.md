If you're excited about the upcoming Ridley Scott movie (The Martian) as I am, you'll enjoy learning more about the many open questions about Mars explained in the documentary below. It includes tons of high resolution imagery and topology which are quite recent.

Standard theory of planetary formation rests on accretion by graviational pull, pummelling by asteroids and various geological phenomenon (water and wind erosion, volcanic and tectonic activity). But many observations don't fit in this model.
For instance:
* If we try to explain it the topolog of Valles Marineris by erosion and flows, how come the deepest point is in the middle and not at the extremities? Where did all this material flow to?
* How can we explain so many bullseye craters?
* What kind of volcanic activity could achieve the odd shape of the mounts?
* If the trenches are collapsed lava tubes, where was the exit flow, and where are the debris?
* How to explain the fields of spherical debris observed by the rovers?
* How did Martian rocks end up on Earth, given that the energy required would have left a big hole in Mars?
* If Phobos was formed by accretion of matter, how did it hold together when it received the massive apparent impact on its end?

The folks who made this documentary have a thesis (dubbed Electric Universe) that the standard theory of neutral bodies interacting mostly gravitationally needs to be expanded with electric interactions. Planetary scale and interplanetary thunderbolts could explain many of the patterns observed, based on smaller scale experiments in the lab.  
Although controversial, I feel this part of the EU thesis has some plausibility and potential.  

If you check out [part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7EAlTcZFwY) of this documentary, you will find some even more adventurous and controversial ideas. In short, the planetary arrangement of the solar system as we know it is fairly new and there were massive changes as recently as antiquity. The sky would have looked very differently, with Venus, Mars and Saturn in different relative positions and orbits, and with electrical artifacts, such as Venus having a crown (like the tail of a comet or an aurora borealis), Mars having a similar electic/plasmic tail, and also some inter-planetary thunderbolts. This theory is formed by looking at the commonality of depictions of the sky across cultures and throughout the ages.
