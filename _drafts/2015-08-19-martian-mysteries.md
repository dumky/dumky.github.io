If you're excited about the upcoming Ridley Scott movie (The Martian) as I am, you'll enjoy learning more about the many open questions about Mars gathered in the documentary below. It includes tons of high resolution imagery and topology which are quite recent.

Standard theory of planetary formation rests on accretion by gravitational pull, pummeling by asteroids, and various geological phenomenon (water and wind erosion, volcanic and tectonic activity). But many observations don't fit in this model.  
For instance: 

* If Valles Marineris was formed by erosion and flows, how come the deepest point is in the middle and not at the extremities? Where did all the alluvial material flow to? 
* How can we explain so many so-called bullseye craters?
* What kind of volcanic activity could achieve the odd shape of the mounts?
* If the trenches are collapsed lava tubes, where are the tubes' exits, and where are the collapsed debris?
* How to explain the remarkable fields of spherical debris observed by the rovers?
* How did Martian rocks end up on Earth, without the necessary impact having left a massive crater?
* If Phobos was formed by accretion of Martian matter and satellites, how did it hold together after the collision that left the apparent crater?

The folks who made this documentary have a thesis (dubbed Electric Universe) that the standard theory of neutral bodies interacting mostly gravitationally needs to be expanded with electric interactions. Planetary scale and interplanetary thunderbolts could explain many of the patterns observed on Mars, based on smaller scale experiments in the lab. And similar interactions and galactic scale plasma would explain other observations.   
Although controversial, I feel this part of the EU thesis has some plausibility and potential. I'm curious to see it get expanded and explored.  

More edgy is [part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7EAlTcZFwY) of this documentary, which offers even more adventurous and controversial ideas. In short, the planetary arrangement of the solar system as we know it is fairly new (thousands of years only) and there were massive changes as recently as antiquity. The sky would have looked very differently, with Venus, Mars and Saturn in different relative positions and orbits, and with electrical artifacts, such as Venus having a crown (like the tail of a comet or an aurora borealis), Mars having a similar electric/plasma tail, and also some inter-planetary thunderbolts. This theory is formed by looking at the commonality of depictions of the sky across cultures and throughout the ages.  
Although the authors are clearly knowledgeable about ancient art and writings, and stitch it into a clever and somewhat compelling narrative, they do not even attempt to explain the transition from such electrically active sky to the current situation.
