Ethereum is quite fascinating. Assuming I understood it properly, I feel that it was not explained very well. 
At it's core, it is a virtual machine. I'll focus on the programming abstraction it creates.
The core concept of Ethereum programming is an object. An object is some state and some public methods, and it can be referenced by an address. 
So far, this sounds mundane.
But there are a few things that make this different from common programming models:
1. Objects run in a shared space across the network, which is actually implemented in a decentralized P2P system
2. The VM provides some useful and strong guarantees
