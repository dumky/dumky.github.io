Ethereum is quite fascinating. 
I'll focus on the programming abstraction the Ethereum Virtual Machine presents.
The core concept of Ethereum programming is an object. An object has some state and some public methods, and can be referenced by an address. 
So far, this sounds mundane.
But there are a few things that make this different from common programming platforms:
1. Objects run in a shared space and can be addressed by any participant on the network
2. Despite that, it provides essential and strong guarantees: encapsulation, integrity of code, memory safety, ...
So the abstraction that is provided is a form of trustable and strict object runtime (which reminds me of capability-based objects and the E programming language), while the substrate is a fully decentralized P2P network of nodes.
Under the covers, Ethereum is a set of protocols to implement a computation system on a blockchain.
