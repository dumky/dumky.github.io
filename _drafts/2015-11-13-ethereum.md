Ethereum is quite fascinating. Assuming I understood it properly, I feel that it was not explained very well. 
At it's core, it is a virtual machine. I'll focus on the programming abstraction it creates.
The core concept of Ethereum programming is an object. An object is some state and some public methods, and it can be referenced by an address. 
So far, this sounds mundane.
But there are a few things that make this different from common programming models:
1. Objects run in a shared space and can be addressed by any participant on the network
2. The VM provides some useful and strong guarantees: encapsulation, integrity of code, memory safety, ...
So the abstraction that is provided is a form of trustable and strict object runtime (which reminds me of capability-based objects and the E programming language), while the substrate is a fully decentralized P2P network of nodes.
