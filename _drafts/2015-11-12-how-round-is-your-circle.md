I found this book a delightful blend of geometry and engineering problems. It covers a number of interesting topics:

* How to build a linkage that will draw a straight line? 
* How to mark graduations on the "first" ruler or sector (requires difficult angle divisions such as trisection)? A later chapter goes into the history and significance of slide rules with logarithmic and other scales.
* How to draw a arc of a large circle?
* How to measure with precision (Vernier scales, magnifiers and fine-threaded screws)?
* How to measure surfaces? This chapter explains how planimeters work (tools to measure surfaces by drawing contours, surprising and effective).
* How to make shapes and volumes of constant width, and conversely how to measure departure from roundness (a hard problem).
