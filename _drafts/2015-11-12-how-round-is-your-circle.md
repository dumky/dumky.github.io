An delightful blend of geometry and engineering problems.
How to build a linkage that will draw a straight line, how to mark graduations on a ruler or a sector (requires difficult angle divisions such as trisection),
How to draw a arc of a large circle
How to measure with precision (Vernier scales, magnifiers and fine-threaded screws) with applications to astronomical observation.
A study from first principles of measurement of surfaces, including surprising but effective planimeters (tools to measure surfaces by drawing contours) and quick discussion of finite surfaces with infinite perimeters (snowflake) or infinite fragmentation (Cantor set).
Shapes and volumes of constant width
Measuring departure from roundness (a hard problem)
The history and significance of slide rules with logarithmic and other scales, some designed for general purpose and others for specific purposes.
