# Personal cell

I've been keeping an eye on the pCell technology for a while. It's pretty exciting.
The problem is that normal wireless networks share bandwidth within a cell (area covered by one antenna). So the more devices you add and the less bandwidth they each receive. Also, different cells interfere with each other which means even less bandwidth.  
The solution is to leverage interference and have multiple antennas covering the same area. Each antenna sends the same data, but each of their signals is delayed so that together they create a constructive interference right where your device is located.  
Some people were not sure whether such a design would be compatible with Shannon's channel limit. I'm not sure how that concern was resolved, but the demos and released product seem to suggest pCell does not fall in the conditions for Shannon's theorem.
