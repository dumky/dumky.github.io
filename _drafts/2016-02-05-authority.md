A few movies recently came out which tackle the theme of obedience to authority and the corruption to power. All three are quite chilling if not outright disturbing. They show how far many people go where guided by "authority" or granted authority themselves.

Experimenter (2015)
Stanley Milgram

Most scientific, with multiple variants producing similar results.


The Stanford Prison Experiment (2015)
Philip Zimbardo
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420293/
Interrupted early.
"Twenty-four male students out of seventy-five were selected to take on randomly assigned roles of prisoners and guards in a mock prison situated in the basement of the Stanford psychology building."

Compliance (2012) 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1971352/

The conditions for creating this situation were the most sketchy (and unscientific and unethical), as this was a scam perpetrated on some fast food joints.
"When a prank caller claiming to be a police officer convinces a fast food restaurant manager to interrogate an innocent young employee, no one is left unharmed."
