A few movies recently came out which tackle the theme of obedience to authority and the corruption to power. 
How far would you go?

Experimenter (2015)
Milgram
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3726704/
Most scientific, with multiple variants producing similar results.


The Stanford Prison Experiment (2015)
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420293/
Interrupted early.
"Twenty-four male students out of seventy-five were selected to take on randomly assigned roles of prisoners and guards in a mock prison situated in the basement of the Stanford psychology building."

Compliance (2012) 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1971352/
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strip_search_phone_call_scam
The conditions for creating this situation were the most sketchy (and unscientific and unethical), as this was a scam perpetrated on some fast food joints.
"When a prank caller claiming to be a police officer convinces a fast food restaurant manager to interrogate an innocent young employee, no one is left unharmed."
